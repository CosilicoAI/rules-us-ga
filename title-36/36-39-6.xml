          <p>Any railroad or street railway having tracks located in a street at the time of a proposed improvement shall be required by the governing body to pave the width of its tracks and two feet on each side thereof. Such paving shall be done with the same material and in the same manner as the rest of the street to be paved, provided that the governing body may require such paving to be of a different material and manner of construction when, in its judgment, this is rendered necessary by the uses of the street by the railway. The work shall be performed under the supervision and subject to the approval of the city's municipal corporation's engineer. If the railway, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the notice to do such work, does not agree in writing to comply with such order or if the work is not completed to the satisfaction of the municipal corporation's engineer within such time as may be prescribed by the governing body, the governing body may have the work done and may charge the cost and expense thereof to the railway company. The governing body shall have a lien against the railway company for such cost and expense. Such lien shall have the same rank and priority and shall be enforced in the same manner as the liens provided for in Code Section 36-39-20.</p>
