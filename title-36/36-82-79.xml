          <p>Bonds validated under this article shall have stamped or written thereon, by the proper officers of the governmental body issuing the same or by their agents or servants, the words "Validated and confirmed by judgment of the superior court," specifying also the date the judgment was rendered and the court in which it was rendered, which entry shall be signed by the clerk of the superior court in which the judgment was rendered. Such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of the judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state. If provisions in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds grant conversion or exchangeability privileges with respect thereto, upon request of the proper officers of the governmental body issuing bonds in exchange for bonds previously signed by a clerk of the superior court, it shall be the duty of such clerk of the superior court to sign the entry as to judgment of validation made on such bonds proposed to be issued in exchange. Such entry shall likewise be received as original evidence of the fact of such judgment in any court in this state. As specified in the general laws of this state, any clerk of a superior court may sign such entry as to the judgment of validation by a manual or a facsimile signature. The clerk of the superior court shall receive for his services rendered under this Code section the fee prescribed in Code Section 15-6-77.</p>
