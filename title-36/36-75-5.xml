          <p>Control and management of the authority shall be vested in a board of directors whose members shall be residents of the county or municipal corporation, as applicable. Directors shall be appointed, and may be reappointed, for terms of four years. The resolution or ordinance activating the authority shall state the number of directors and the appointing authority for each. No member of the governing authority of a county or municipal corporation that activates an authority is eligible to be appointed as a director while serving a term of office as a member of the governing authority of such county or municipal corporation. The directors shall elect one of their members as chairperson and another as vice chairperson and shall also elect a secretary and a treasurer or a secretary-treasurer, either of whom may be a director. The directors shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for their actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. The directors may make bylaws and regulations for the governing of the authority and may delegate to one or more of the officers, agents, and employees of the authority such powers and duties as may be deemed necessary and proper.</p>
