          <p>The department shall administer, operate, and manage the system. Action taken by the department, however, shall not constitute an opinion of the department on any legal matters with respect to the federal or state tax treatment of any bonds. Without limiting the generality of the department's power and authority to administer, operate, and manage the system, the department shall make such determinations and decisions, promulgate such rules, require the use of such forms, establish such procedures, and otherwise administer, operate, and manage the system in such respects as may be, in the department's determination, necessary, desirable, or incident to its responsibilities as the administrator, operator, and manager of the system. The General Assembly recognizes and acknowledges that the department will encounter situations which have not been foreseen or provided for in this article and expressly delegates to the department the power and authority to administer, operate, and manage the system in all situations and circumstances, both foreseen and unforeseen, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the power and authority to control and establish procedures for controlling any misuse or abuses of the system and the power and authority to resolve conflicts or inconsistencies, if any, in this article or which may arise in administering, operating, or managing the system pursuant to this article. Any decision which the commissioner or the department makes, and any action or inaction by the commissioner or the department, in administering, managing, and operating the system shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to any review, whether judicial, administrative, or otherwise, and shall not be covered by, subject to, or required to comply with or satisfy any provisions of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." The system depends upon the truthfulness of representations made and information submitted in or accompanying applications. The department may use all of the power and authority granted in this article, and such other power or authority as the commissioner may deem necessary or appropriate, in order to take action against those who fail to comply with any of the provisions of this article or who fail to display the truthfulness, which shall include the completeness necessary to avoid untruthfulness by omission, which the commissioner deems necessary for the system. Without limiting the generality of this article, the General Assembly expressly delegates to the department the power and authority to control, permit to be used, or refuse to permit to be used any allocation which would reduce the state ceiling under Section 146(m) of the Federal Code, dealing with the private activity portion of governmental use bonds; and the department, to accomplish this end, may impose requirements upon any issuer, including any other agency or department of the state or any county or municipality or agency, department, or authority of a county or municipality within the state.</p>
