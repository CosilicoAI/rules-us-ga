              <p>No person, firm, association, or corporation carrying on or conducting within this state any business requiring the employment of labor shall refuse to hire, employ, or license nor shall such person, firm, association, or corporation bar or discharge from employment any individual between the ages of 40 and 70 years, solely upon the ground of age, when the reasonable demands of the position do not require such an age distinction, provided that such individual is qualified physically, mentally, and by training and experience to perform satisfactorily the labor assigned to him or for which he applies. Nothing in this Code section shall affect the retirement policy or system of any employer where such policy or system is not merely a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this Code section. When the retirement or insurance benefit program of any employer shall prohibit the employment of any person because of excessive age, such person shall have the authority, as a condition of employment, to waive the right to participate in any such program and receive any benefits therefrom. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit compulsory retirement of any employee who has attained 65 years of age but not 70 years of age and who, for the two-year period immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or a high policy-making position, if such employee is entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit from a pension, profit-sharing, savings, or deferred compensation plan, or any combination of such plans, of the employer of such employee, which equals, in the aggregate, at least $27,000.00.</p>

              <p>An employer may provide reasonable unpaid break time each day to an employee who needs to express breast milk for her infant child. The employer may make reasonable efforts to provide a room or other location (in close proximity to the work area), other than a toilet stall, where the employee can express her milk in privacy. The break time shall, if possible, run concurrently with any break time already provided to the employee. An employer is not required to provide break time under this Code section if to do so would unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.

              <p>Upon filing a petition with the court for an injunction pursuant to this Code section, the petitioner may obtain a temporary restraining order if the petitioner also files an affidavit which, to the satisfaction of the court, shows reasonable proof that an employee has suffered unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence by the respondent and that great or irreparable harm shall result to an employee if such an injunction is not granted. The affidavit shall further show that the petitioner has conducted a reasonable investigation into the underlying facts which are the subject of the petition. A temporary restraining order granted under this Code section shall remain in effect, at the court's discretion, for a period not to exceed 15 days, unless otherwise modified or terminated by the court.</p>

              <p>Within ten days of filing of the petition under this Code section or as soon as practical thereafter, but in no case later than 30 days after the filing of the petition, a hearing shall be held on the petition for the injunction. In the event a hearing cannot be scheduled within the county where the case is pending within the 30 day period, the same shall be scheduled and heard within any other county of the circuit. The respondent may file a response which explains, excuses, justifies, or denies the alleged unlawful violence or credible threat of violence or may file a cross-complaint under this Code section. At the hearing, the judge shall receive any testimony that is relevant and may make an independent inquiry. If the judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent engaged in unlawful violence or made a credible threat of violence, an injunction shall issue prohibiting further unlawful violence or threats of violence at the employee's workplace or while the employee is acting within the course and scope of employment with the employer. An injunction issued pursuant to this Code section shall have a duration of not more than three years. At any time within the three months before the expiration of the injunction, the petitioner may apply for a renewal of the injunction by filing a new petition for an injunction pursuant to this Code section.</p>

(C)  Education beyond high school;

(D)  Vocational education;

(E)  Demonstrated proficiency with a specified type of machinery; or(F)  Training before the assignment or on the job which exceeds one hour.

          <content>
            <p>§ 34-5-1. Declaration of public policy regarding discriminatory wage practices based on sex
The General Assembly declares that the practice of discriminating on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees of one sex at a lesser rate than the rate paid to employees of the opposite sex for comparable work in jobs which require the same, or essentially the same, knowledge, skill, effort, and responsibility unjustly discriminates against the person receiving the lesser rate; leads to low worker morale, high turnover, and frequent labor unrest; discourages workers paid at the lesser wage rates from training for higher level jobs; curtails employment opportunities; decreases mobility of workers and increases labor costs; impairs purchasing power and threatens the maintenance of an adequate standard of living by such workers and their families; prevents optimum utilization of the labor resources available to the state; threatens the well-being of citizens of this state; and adversely affects the general welfare. It is declared to be the policy of the State of Georgia to eliminate, as rapidly as possible, by exercise of the police power of this state, discriminatory wage practices based on sex.

In the event any dispute should arise between any employer and employee covered by this chapter in relation to any subject matter which is covered by this chapter, either of the parties shall have the right to request arbitration of the dispute. The party requesting arbitration shall file written notice of his request with the opposite party by either registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. Within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the other party shall either accept or reject the arbitration offer. If the offer is accepted, the employer and the employee shall each select and appoint one arbitrator within ten days after acceptance. The arbitrators so selected shall then select a county adjoining the county in which the business of the employer is located and in which the dispute arose and the judge of the superior court or the senior judge thereof in terms of length of service on the bench of the judicial circuit in which such selected county shall be located shall appoint a third arbitrator who shall act as the chairman of the arbitration committee. The arbitration committee shall meet at such time as shall be fixed by the chairman and, after giving notice of the hearing to the parties concerned and affording them an opportunity to appear and be heard on the matters in dispute, shall proceed to resolve all matters contained within the request for arbitration. The decision of the arbitration committee shall be binding upon the parties affected, except that either party may appeal such decision to any court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days from publication of the decision.

An employee assumes the ordinary risks of his employment and is bound to exercise his own skill and diligence to protect himself. In actions for injuries arising from the negligence of the employer in failing to comply with the duties imposed by Code Section 34-7-20, in order that the employee may recover, it must appear that the employer knew or ought to have known of the incompetency of the other employee or of the defects or danger in the machinery supplied; and it must also appear that the employee injured did not know and had not equal means of knowing such fact and by the exercise of ordinary care could not have known thereof.

          <content>
            <p>§ 34-7-41. Liability of common carrier by railroad for personal injury or death of employee generally
Every common carrier by railroad shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier or, in case of death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving spouse or child or children of such employee; and if none, then of such employee's parents; and if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier or by reason of any defects or insufficiency, due to the carrier's negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment; provided, however, that there shall be no recovery under this Code section if the person killed or injured brought about his death or injury by his own carelessness amounting to a failure to exercise ordinary care or if he, by the exercise of ordinary care, could have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence. The measure of damages in case the injury results in death of the employee shall be that prescribed in Code Sections 51-4-1, 51-4-2, and 51-4-4; provided, however, that parties who may recover under this Code section, Code Sections 34-7-42 through 34-7-44, and Code Section 34-7-46 may sue and recover in their own names in the manner prescribed by Code Sections 51-4-2 and 51-4-4 in case no administrator or executor has been appointed at the time the action is filed. In case death shall result from injury to the employee, the employer shall be liable unless it, its agents, and its employees have exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence, the presumption being in all cases against the employer. If death shall not result from the injury, the presumption of negligence shall be and remain as provided by law in case of injury received by an employee in the service of a railroad company.

          <content>
            <p>§ 34-8-2. Declaration of public policy
As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of this state is declared to be as follows: economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state. Involuntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the General Assembly to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker or the worker's family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of our economic life. This can be provided by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance. The General Assembly therefore declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the state, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.

As used in this chapter, the term "temporary help contracting firm" means any person who is in the business of employing individuals and, for compensation from a third party, providing those individuals to perform work for the third party under the general or direct supervision of the third party.

A separate employment contract exists between the temporary help contracting firm and each individual it hires as an employee. Completion of an assignment for a third party by an employee employed by a temporary help contracting firm does not, in itself, terminate the employment contract between the temporary help contracting firm and the employee.

This state recognizes its obligation to replace and declares it to be the policy of this state that funds will be provided in the future and applied to the replacement of any moneys received from the United States secretary of labor or the federal official responsible for the allocation of funds for the administration of this chapter and for making other administrative determinations within the federal province under Title III of the federal Social Security Act; any unencumbered balances in the Employment Security Administration Fund as of that date; any moneys thereafter granted to this state pursuant to the provisions of the federal Wagner-Peyser Act; and any moneys made available by the state or its political subdivisions and matched by such moneys granted to this state pursuant to the provisions of the federal Wagner-Peyser Act, which the United States secretary of labor or other responsible federal official finds, because of any action or contingency, have been lost or have been expended for purposes other than or in amounts in excess of those found necessary by the United States secretary of labor or other responsible federal official. Such moneys shall be promptly replaced by moneys appropriated for such purpose from the general funds of this state to the Employment Security Administration Fund for expenditure as provided in Code Section 34-8-81. The Commissioner shall promptly report to the Governor, and the Governor to the General Assembly, the amount required for such replacement.

            <p>§ 34-8-84. Commissioner as custodian of fund; establishment of accounts within fund; deposits of money in accounts
The Commissioner shall be custodian of the Unemployment Compensation Fund and shall administer the fund in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commissioner shall prescribe. The Commissioner shall maintain within the fund three separate accounts: (1) a clearing account, (2) an unemployment trust fund account, and (3) a benefit account. The Commissioner shall immediately deposit all moneys payable to the fund, upon receipt thereof, in the clearing account. Refunds payable pursuant to Code Section 34-8-164 may be paid from the clearing account or the benefit account upon authorization issued by the Commissioner. After clearance thereof, all other moneys in the clearing account shall be immediately deposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States to the credit of the account of this state in the Unemployment Trust Fund established and maintained pursuant to Section 904 of the Social Security Act, as amended, any provisions of law in this state relating to the deposit, administration, release, or disbursement of moneys in the possession or custody of this state to the contrary notwithstanding. The benefit account shall consist of all moneys requisitioned from this state's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Except as otherwise provided in this Code section, moneys in the clearing and benefit accounts may be deposited by the Commissioner in any bank or public depository in which general funds of the state may be deposited, but no public deposit insurance charge or premium shall be paid out of the fund; provided, however, that any charges for exchange on local bank checks in payment of contributions may be paid as expense of collection from the Employment Security Administration Fund. Such money shall be secured by the depository bank to the same extent and in the same manner as required by the general depository laws of this state; and collateral pledged for this purpose or bonds given for this purpose shall be kept separate and distinct from any collateral pledged to secure the other funds of the state. The Commissioner shall be liable on the Commissioner's official bond for the faithful performance of duties in connection with the Unemployment Compensation Fund as provided under this chapter.  All sums recovered on any surety bond for losses sustained by the Unemployment Compensation Fund shall be deposited in said fund.

Code Sections 34-8-83 through 34-8-85, to the extent that they relate to the Unemployment Trust Fund, shall be operative only so long as such trust fund continues to exist and so long as the secretary of the treasury of the United States continues to maintain for this state a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by this state for benefit purposes, together with this state's proportionate share of the earnings of the Unemployment Trust Fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals. If and when such Unemployment Trust Fund ceases to exist or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all moneys, properties, or securities therein belonging to the Unemployment Compensation Fund of this state shall be transferred to the treasurer of the Unemployment Compensation Fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release such funds, properties, or securities in a manner approved by the Commissioner in accordance with this chapter; provided, however, that such funds shall be invested in the bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of the United States of America and of the State of Georgia; and provided, further, that such investment shall at all times be so made that all the assets of the fund shall always be readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The Commissioner, as custodian, shall have the discretionary authority to dispose of securities or other properties belonging to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.

              <p>The General Assembly recognizes that records and information held by the Department of Labor could be misused.  Therefore, it is the intent of this article to define a right of privacy and confidentiality as regards individual and employing unit records and other records maintained by the Department of Labor.  The General Assembly further recognizes that there are situations where this right of privacy and confidentiality is outweighed by other considerations.  Therefore, it is the intent of this article to define also certain exceptions to the right of privacy and confidentiality.

            <p>§ 34-8-127. Disclosure of information or records when necessary to permit private parties to assist in operation of department; penalty for violations; enforcement by Attorney General
The department shall have the right to disclose information or records deemed private and confidential under this chapter to any private person or organization when such disclosure is necessary to permit private contracting parties to assist in the operation and management of the department in instances where certain departmental functions may be delegated to private parties to increase the department's efficiency or quality of service to the public.  The private persons or organizations shall use the information or records solely for the purpose for which the information was disclosed and shall be bound by the same rules of privacy and confidentiality as department employees.  The misuse or unauthorized release of records or information deemed private and confidential under this article by any private person or organization to which access is permitted by this Code section shall subject the person or organization to a civil penalty of $500.00 per violation and shall also subject such person or organization to the criminal provisions specified in Code Section 34-8-125. An action to enforce this Code section shall be brought by the Attorney General.  The Attorney General may recover reasonable attorneys' fees for any action brought to enforce this Code section.

If the required tax and wage reports remain unfiled 30 days following notice, the employer will not be eligible for a rate computation but shall be assigned the maximum rate allowable after application of the State-wide Reserve Ratio, if computed for such year, as provided in Code Section 34-8-156. Employers having positive reserve accounts will be assigned the maximum rate allowable for positive reserve accounts. Employers having deficit reserve accounts will be assigned the maximum rate allowable for deficit reserve accounts.

              <p>A State-wide Reserve Ratio shall be computed as of June 30 of each year by dividing the balance in the trust fund, including accrued interest, by the total covered wages paid in the state during the previous calendar year. Any amount credited to the state's account under Section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, which has been appropriated for the expenses of administration, whether or not withdrawn from the trust fund, shall be excluded from the trust fund balance in computing the State-wide Reserve Ratio.</p>

              <p>The Commissioner shall by regulation provide for the notification of each employer of charges made against its account at intervals not less frequent than semiannually. The charges in such notification shall be binding upon each employer for all purposes unless the employer files a request for review and redetermination in writing. Such request must set forth the charges to which the employer objects and the basis of the objection. The request must be made within 15 days of the prescribed notification. Upon such request being filed, the employer shall be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing. However, no employer shall have standing in any proceeding to contest the chargeability to its account of any benefit paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination, or decision pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of this chapter, except upon the ground that the services upon which such benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in employment for the employer and only in the event that the employer was not a party to such determination, redetermination, or decision, or to any other proceedings under this chapter in which the character of such services was determined. The employer shall be promptly notified of the Commissioner's redetermination. The redetermination shall become final unless a petition for judicial review is filed within 15 days after notice of redetermination. Such notice shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the employer's last known address. The petition for judicial review shall be filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county of residence of the petitioner. In any proceeding under this Code section, the findings of the Commissioner as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be confined to questions of law. No additional evidence shall be received by the court, but the court may order additio</p>

(3)  Payments made not to be deducted from remuneration of individuals.  Payments made by any governmental entity or nonprofit organization under this Code section shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the governmental entity or nonprofit organization;

(4)  Amount specified in billing conclusive.  The amount due specified in any billing notice from the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Code section shall be conclusive unless, not later than 15 days after the billing notice was mailed to its last known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the Commissioner, setting forth the grounds for such application or appeal. The Commissioner shall promptly review and reconsider the amount due specified in the billing notice and shall thereafter issue a redetermination in any case in which such application for redetermination has been filed. Any such redetermination shall be conclusive with respect to the organization unless, not later than 15 days after the redetermination was mailed to its last known address or otherwise delivered, the organization files an appeal, setting forth the grounds for the appeal. Proceedings on appeal from the amount of a billing notice rendered under this Code section or a redetermination of such amount shall be in accordance with regulations as prescribed by the Commissioner; and

(5)  Past due payments.  Past due payments in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest and penalties that, pursuant to Code Sections 34-8-165 and 34-8-166, apply to past due contributions.  Interest or penalties shall not accrue with respect to any portion of the amount billed on which the employer prevails in the redetermination, but shall continue to accrue as to any portion of the amount billed on which the employer does not prevail.

              <p>Authority to require surety bond.  For the purposes of this Code section, a surety bond is a bond of surety issued by an organization licensed and authorized to issue such bond in the State of Georgia. In the discretion of the Commissioner, any organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required, within 30 days after the effective date of its election, to execute and file with the Commissioner a cash deposit or surety bond approved by the Commissioner. In the sole discretion of the Commissioner, the department may secure such bonds and defray all or any portion of such cost to the employers covered under the bond.  In the event the Commissioner elects to require any organization to execute and file a cash deposit or surety bond, the amount of such deposit or surety bond shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection</p>

            <p>§ 34-8-161. Group accounts
Two or more employers who have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 34-8-158 may file a joint application to the Commissioner for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for the purposes of this Code section. Upon the approval of the application, the Commissioner shall establish a group account for such employers, effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the Commissioner receives the application, and shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than two calendar years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the Commissioner or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bear to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The Commissioner shall prescribe such regulations as deemed necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance, and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this Code section, for addition of new members to and withdrawal of active members from such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this Code section by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.

Applications for an adjustment or a refund of contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, or interest thereon, shall be submitted no later than three years from the date such amounts were assessed. Applications must be in writing. The Commissioner shall determine what amounts, if any, were erroneously collected. Adjustments shall be made against subsequent payments. Refunds will be issued, without interest thereon, when adjustments cannot be made.

Amounts shall be refunded from the fund into which they were deposited.

In the discretion of the Commissioner, an adjustment or refund may be made after a lien has issued and been recorded, but only if the Commissioner is satisfied the report is complete and accurate.  The Commissioner shall require such documentation and may inspect any books or records of the employer as the Commissioner deems necessary to make this determination.  An adjustment to the amount due may be made if the lien has not yet been satisfied.  If the lien has been satisfied, a refund may be issued by the Commissioner.

            <p>§ 34-8-175. Payment of contributions when employing unit sells or transfers business or stock of goods
Any employing unit which sells or transfers its business or stock of goods shall file all required tax and wage reports and pay all contributions, administrative assessments, interest, and penalties within 30 days after such sale or transfer.  Such reports and payments shall include all wages for employment up to the date of the sale or transfer.  The purchaser, transferee, successor, or assignee shall withhold a sufficient amount from the purchase money to cover the amount of all contributions, administrative assessments, interest, and penalties due and unpaid by the seller or transferor.  If the seller or transferor fails to make required payments within the 30 days specified, then the purchaser, transferee, successor, or assignee shall pay the money so withheld.  If the purchaser, transferee, successor, or assignee fails to do so, it shall become liable for such contributions, administrative assessments, interest, and penalties.  After 30 days the purchaser, transferee, or successor will also become jointly and severally responsible with the predecessor for filing of any delinquent reports.  If the payment of moneys is not involved in the sale or transfer, such purchaser shall withhold the performance of the condition that constitutes the consideration for the transfer until the Commissioner certifies that all reports have been filed and all contributions, administrative assessments, interest, and penalties have been paid.

            <p>§ 34-8-177. Procedure for collecting delinquent contribution payments from public employers
Should any department or political subdivision of the state, any instrumentality of a political subdivision of the state, or any instrumentality of one or more of the foregoing become more than 120 days delinquent in contributions or payments in lieu of contributions due to the Unemployment Compensation Fund, the Department of Labor shall certify to the Office of the State Treasurer the amount due. The Office of the State Treasurer shall transfer the amount due to the Department of Labor from funds it has available for distribution to the respective department or political subdivision of the state, instrumentality of a political subdivision of the state, or instrumentality of one or more of the foregoing. The certification shall be signed by the Commissioner and shall be conclusive proof of the delinquency. The Commissioner shall mail a copy of the certification to the delinquent public employer on the date of transmittal to the Department of Administrative Services. Should the public employer wish to appeal the Commissioner's decision, it shall so notify the Commissioner within 15 days from the date the certification is mailed to the public employer. The Commissioner shall, upon receipt of the notice, request the Attorney General to appoint an independent attorney as an administrative hearing officer to hear all issues involved and render a decision. Should the public employer or the Commissioner contest the administrative hearing officer's decision, an appeal may be filed, within 30 days after the decision of the administrative hearing officer has been mailed, in the superior court of the county in which the decision was rendered. The Attorney General shall represent the Commissioner in any such matters appealed.

            <p>§ 34-8-178. Voluntary contributions by employers
Any employer may make voluntary payments in addition to the contributions required under this chapter, and the same shall be credited to the employer's experience account; provided, however, that such voluntary contributions shall not be used in the computation of reduced rates unless such contributions are paid within 30 days following the date upon which the Commissioner mails notice that such payments may be made with respect to a calendar year, and in no event shall such payments be made later than the expiration of 120 days after the beginning of the year for which such rates are effective. Such voluntary payments when accepted from an employer will not be refunded in whole or in part.

              <p>The weekly benefit amount of an individual's claim shall be that amount computed by dividing the two highest quarters of wages paid in the base period by 42. Any fraction of a dollar shall then be disregarded. Wages must have been paid in at least two quarters of the base period and total wages in the base period must equal or exceed 150 percent of the highest quarter base period wages. For claims that fail to establish entitlement due to failure to meet the 150 percent requirement, an alternative computation shall be made. In such event, the weekly benefit amount shall be computed by dividing the highest single quarter of base period wages paid by 21. Any fraction of a dollar shall then be disregarded. Under this alternative computation, wages must have been paid in at least two quarters of the base period and total base period wages must equal or exceed 40 times the weekly benefit amount. Regardless of the method of computation used, wages must have been paid for insured work, as defined in Code Section 34-8-41.</p>

              <p>To accompany a spouse who has been reassigned from one military assignment to another; or(ii)  Due to family violence verified by reasonable documentation demonstrating that:
(I)  Leaving the employer was a condition of receiving services from a family violence shelter;

(II)  Leaving the employer was a condition of receiving shelter as a resident of a family violence shelter; or(III)  Such family violence caused the individual to reasonably believe that the claimant's continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the claimant or the safety of any member of the claimant's immediate family.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "family violence" shall have the same meaning as in Code Section 19-13-1 and the term "family violence shelter" shall have the same meaning as in Code Section 19-13-20.

(C)  To requalify following a disqualification, an individual must secure subsequent employment for which the individual earns insured wages equal to at least ten times the weekly benefit amount of the claim and then becomes unemployed through no fault on the part of the individual.

(D)  When voluntarily leaving an employer, the burden of proof of good cause in connection with the individual's most recent work shall be on the individual.

(E)  Benefits shall not be denied under this paragraph to an individual for separation from employment pursuant to a labor management contract or agreement or pursuant to an established employer plan, program, policy, layoff, or recall which permits the individual, because of lack of work, to accept a separation from employment;</p>

To requalify following a disqualification, an individual must secure subsequent employment for which the individual earns insured wages equal to at least ten times the weekly benefit amount of the claim and then becomes unemployed through no fault on the part of the individual.

(I)  Intentional conduct on the premises of the employer or while on the job which results in a physical assault upon or bodily injury to the employer, fellow employees, customers, patients, bystanders, or the eventual consumer of products; or

(II)  Intentional conduct that results in the employee's being discharged for, and limited to, the following: theft of property, goods, or money valued at $100.00 or less; and(ii)  An individual shall secure employment and show to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he or she has performed services in bona fide employment and earned insured wages equal to at least 16 times the weekly benefit amount of the claim if it is determined by the Commissioner that the individual has been discharged for cause by the most recent employer for one or more of the following reasons:
(I)  Intentional conduct by the employee which results in property loss or damages amounting to $2,000.00 or more; or(II)  Intentional conduct that results in the employee's being discharged for, and limited to, the following: theft of property, goods, or money valued at over $100.00, sabotage, or embezzlement.(B)  An individual shall not be disqualified for benefits under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph if, based on the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner, the Commissioner determines:</p>

(ii)  The individual did not intentionally fail or consciously neglect to perform his or her job duties;

(iii)  The discharge occurred because of absenteeism and the absences were caused by illness of the claimant or a family member, unless the claimant has without justification failed to notify the employer or the absence for such illness which led to discharge followed a series of absences, the majority of which were attributable to fault on the part of the claimant in direct violation of the employer's attendance policy and regarding which the claimant has been advised in writing, prior to any of the absences, that unemployment benefits may be denied due to such violations of the employer's policy on attendance; provided, however, that no waiver of an employee's rights under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, or any other applicable state or federal law shall be construed under this division;

(iv)  The discharge occurred as a violation of the employer's rule of which the claimant was not informed by having been made aware thereof by the employer or through common knowledge. Consistency of prior enforcement shall be taken into account as to the reasonableness or existence of the rule and such rule must be lawful and reasonably related to the job environment and job performance; or</p>

(ii)  The laboratory test results, including but not limited to, documentation of the chain of custody, methodology, and the accuracy of the drug screening test shall be admissible and self-authenticating in an administrative hearing conducted by the Commissioner with respect to a disputed claim for unemployment benefits under this chapter, and such evidence shall create a rebuttable presumption that the individual violated the employer's drug-free workplace policy; provided, however, that any other evidence relating to the issue of eligibility and the provisions of this subparagraph may be received in person or by telecommunications at the hearing; and

(iii)  Laboratory test results submitted by the individual, including but not limited to documentation of the chain of custody, methodology, and the accuracy of the drug screening test shall be admissible and self-authenticating in an administrative hearing conducted by the Commissioner with respect to a disputed claim for unemployment benefits under this chapter;</p>

                <p>(A) If, after the claimant has filed an otherwise valid claim for benefits, the claimant has failed without good cause either to apply for available, suitable work when so directed by an employment office or the Commissioner or to accept suitable work when offered to the claimant by any employer.  Such disqualification shall continue until he or she has secured subsequent employment for which the individual has earned insured wages equal to at least ten times the weekly benefit amount of the claim and has lost that job through no fault on the part of the individual.
(B)  In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the Commissioner shall consider the degree of risk involved to his or her health, safety, and morals; his or her physical fitness and prior training; his or her experience and prior earnings; his or her length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in his or her customary occupation; and the distance of the available work from his or her residence. The length of unemployment shall be given full consideration and, after an adjustment period, the claimant must accept work involving less competence and at a lower remuneration.  If a claimant has received ten weeks of benefits during his or her current period of unemployment, no work otherwise suitable shall be considered unsuitable because of prior training, experience, prior earnings, or level of compensation, provided such compensation is equal to or exceeds 66 percent of the claimant's highest calendar quarter base period earnings; provided, however, that such compensation must be equal to or greater than the minimum wage established by federal or state laws.(C)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work:</p>

                <p>For any week with respect to which the Commissioner finds that his or her total or partial unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which he or she is or was last employed.  If, in any case, separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purposes of this paragraph, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premises.  This paragraph shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that:
(A)  He or she is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work;

(B)  He or she does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute; or(C)  A lockout has occurred following the expiration of the most recent working agreement without any offer of or refusal to continue that agreement during continued negotiations for a new agreement acceptable to employer and employee.
When a stoppage of work due to a labor dispute ceases and operations are resumed at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the employee is or was last employed but the employee has not been restored to such last employment, the employee's disqualification for benefits under this paragraph shall be deemed to have ceased at such time as the Commissioner shall determine such stoppage of work to have ceased and such operations to have been resumed. Benefits shall not be paid for any week during which the employee is engaged in picketing or is a participant in a picket line at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the employee is or was las</p>

Remuneration for accrued but unused annual leave, vacation pay, sick leave, or payments from employer funded supplemental unemployment plans, pension plans, profit-sharing plans, deferred compensation, or stock bonus plans or seniority buyback plans shall not affect entitlement.

            <p>§ 34-8-222. Procedure for appeal of claims to board of review; record of proceedings
The manner in which appealed claims shall be presented and the conduct of hearings and appeals shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner for determining the rights of the parties.  It is not required that such regulations conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of procedure.  A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with an appealed claim.  All testimony at any hearing upon a claim before the administrative hearing officer shall be mechanically recorded but need not be transcribed unless the disputed claim is further appealed.  The board of review, in its sole discretion, shall have the power to determine the necessity for transcription of any record to be considered by it. However, no provision of this Code section shall preclude the Commissioner from making the original documents, papers, and transcripts available for inspection upon written request by any party to the proceedings. Documents, papers, and transcripts shall be available for inspection during normal working hours at the office of the department in Atlanta or at the local office of the department where the original claim for benefits under this law was filed.  Due to the confidential nature of the proceedings, only agency personnel or the board of review shall be permitted to make a recording of any type whatsoever of any hearing involving a claim for benefits or an appeal therefrom.  The hearing may be recorded by one or both of the interested parties, provided prior written consent is received by the office of administrative appeals from all interested parties.

              <p>Within 15 days after the decision of the board of review has become final, any party aggrieved thereby may secure judicial review by filing a petition against the Commissioner in the superior court of the county where the employee was last employed. In the event the individual was last employed in another state, such appeal shall be filed in Fulton County, Georgia. Any other party to the proceeding before the board of review shall be made a respondent. The petition, which need not be verified but which shall state specifically the grounds upon which a review is sought, shall be served upon the Commissioner or upon his or her designee within 30 days from the date of filing. Such service upon the Commissioner shall be made by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested; hand delivery; or in a manner prescribed by the law of this state for service of process to Georgia Department of Labor, Unemployment Insurance Legal Section, Suite 826, 148 Andrew Young International Boulevard, N.E., Atlanta, GA 30303-1751. Such service shall be deemed completed service on all parties, but there shall be so served upon the Commissioner or his or her designee as many copies of the petition as there are respondents. The Commissioner shall mail one such copy to each such respondent. Within 30 days after the service of the petition, the Commissioner shall certify and file with the superior court all documents and papers and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter, together with the board of review's findings of fact and decision therein. The Commissioner shall not be required to furnish any person with a copy of the aforementioned documents, papers, or transcripts or the original of these items prior to the Commissioner's filing these items with the court.

            <p>§ 34-8-255. Effect of false statements and misrepresentations made to obtain or increase benefits
Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact or who knowingly fails to disclose a material fact to obtain or increase benefits under this chapter, either for himself or herself or for any other person, or who knowingly accepts benefits under this chapter to which such person is not entitled shall, upon an appropriate finding by the Commissioner, cease to be eligible for such benefits and an overpayment of benefits shall be computed without the application of deductible earnings as otherwise provided in Code Section 34-8-193. A penalty of 15 percent shall be added to the overpayment and become part of the overpayment. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid portion of such overpayment at a rate of 1 percent per month until repaid to the Commissioner for the Unemployment Compensation Fund. Further, such person shall forfeit all unpaid benefits for any weeks of unemployment subsequent to the date of the determination issued by the Commissioner covering said act or omission. The ineligibility shall include any unpaid benefits to which the person would otherwise be entitled during the remainder of any incomplete calendar quarter in which said determination is made and the next four complete calendar quarters immediately following the date of said determination; provided, however, such person shall be required to repay benefits received for any week as specified in said determination. No determination may be made by the Commissioner more than four years after such occurrence, act, or omission. Any such determination by the Commissioner may be appealed in the same manner as provided for the appeal from an initial determination in Article 8 of this chapter. The provisions of this Code section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any provision contained in any of the other Code sections in this chapter.

            <p>§ 34-8-271. Legislative findings, declarations, and intent
The General Assembly finds and declares that a public purpose is served by the waiver of interest on unemployment tax, penalties, and criminal prosecution in return for the immediate reporting and payment of previously underreported, unreported, or unpaid unemployment contributions liabilities. The General Assembly further finds and declares that the benefits gained through this program include, among other things, increased collection of certain currently owed unemployment contributions, permanently bringing into the unemployment insurance system employers who have been evading payment of unemployment contributions and providing an opportunity for such employers to satisfy unemployment contributions obligations before stepped-up unemployment tax enforcement programs take effect.  It is the intention of the General Assembly in enacting this article that the unemployment tax amnesty program provided under this article be a one-time occurrence which shall not be repeated in the future because employers' expectations of any future amnesty programs could have a counterproductive effect on compliance under this article.

            <p>§ 34-8-272. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Accounts receivable" means an amount of unemployment contribution, tax, administrative assessment, reimbursement in lieu of contributions, penalty, or interest which has been recorded as due and entered in the account records or any ledger maintained in the department, or which an employer should reasonably expect to become due as a direct or indirect result of any pending or completed audit or investigation, which an employer knows is being conducted by any federal, state, or local taxing authority.

(2)  "Employer" means any individual, partnership, joint venture, association, limited liability company, corporation, receiver, trustee, guardian, executor, administrator, fiduciary, or any other entity of any kind subject to any unemployment tax, contribution, or reimbursement in lieu of contributions, or any person required to collect any such unemployment tax, contribution, or reimbursement in lieu of contributions under this chapter, and as further defined in Code Section 34-8-33. The term shall also include any individual who has been deemed personally liable for the debt under the authority of Code Section 34-8-167.

(3)  "Final, due, and owing" means an assessment of unemployment contributions which has become final and is owed to the state due to either the expiration of the employer's appeal rights or, in the case of an assessment which has been appealed, either pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," or pursuant to Code Section 34-8-220, the rendition of the final order by the Commissioner or by any court of this state.  Assessments that have been appealed shall be final, due, and owing 15 days after the last unappealed or unappealable order sustaining the assessment or any part thereof has become final.  Assessments that have not been appealed shall be final, due, and owing 15 days after service of notice of assessment pursuant to Code Section 34-8-170.

(4)  "Unemployment tax" shall include any unemployment tax or contribution, administrative assessment, or reimbursement in lieu of contributions or recording costs incurred thereon.

              <p>of this Code section and the employer's liability under this chapter has been fully or partially paid, then the employer or such employer's insurer shall have a subrogation lien, not to exceed the actual amount of compensation paid pursuant to this chapter, against such recovery. The employer or insurer may intervene in any action to protect and enforce such lien. However, the employer's or insurer's recovery under this Code section shall be limited to the recovery of the amount of disability benefits, death benefits, and medical expenses paid under this chapter and shall only be recoverable if the injured employee has been fully and completely compensated, taking into consideration both the benefits received under this chapter and the amount of the recovery in the third-party claim, for all economic and noneconomic losses incurred as a result of the injury.</p>

If after one year from the date of injury the employee asserts his or her cause of action in tort, then the employee shall immediately notify the employer or its insurer of his or her assertion of such cause of action, and the employer or its insurer shall have a right to intervene. In any case, if the employer or insurer recovers more than the extent of its lien, then the amount in excess thereof shall be paid over to the employee.

              <p>Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed so as to prevent settlements made by and between the employee and employer but rather to encourage them, so long as the amount of compensation and the time and manner of payment are in accordance with this chapter. A workers' compensation insurer shall not be authorized to settle a claim on behalf of its insured employer without giving prior notice to such employer of the terms of the settlement agreement. A copy of any such settlement agreement shall be filed by the employer with the board, and no such settlement shall be binding until approved by the board. Whenever it shall appear to the board, by stipulation of the parties or otherwise, that there is a bona fide dispute as to facts, the determination of which will materially affect the right of the employee or dependent to recover compensation or the amount of compensation to be recovered, or that there is a genuine dispute as to the applicability of this chapter, and it further appears that the parties have agreed upon a settlement between themselves, which settlement gives due regard and weight to the conflicting evidence available relating to the disputed facts or to the questions as to the applicability of this chapter, then, upon such determination, the board shall approve the settlement and enter an award conforming to the terms thereof even though such settlement may provide for the payment of compensation in a sum or sums less than would be payable if there were no conflict as to the employee's right to recover compensation. When such settlement has been agreed upon and approved by the board, it shall constitute a complete and final disposition of all claims on account of the incident, injury, or injuries referred to therein, and the board shall not be authorized to enter upon any award subsequent to such board approval amending, modifying, or changing in any manner the settlement, nor shall the settlement be subject to review by the board under Code S</p>

              <p>The board shall be authorized to approve a stipulated settlement between the parties which concludes that there is no liability under this chapter and to retain jurisdiction to enforce any agreement which resolves, in whole or in part, a claim filed with the board. If payments required under such an agreement are not made within 20 days, the board may assess a penalty of 20 percent in the same manner as provided in Code Section 34-9-221. When such settlement has been agreed upon and approved by the board, it shall constitute a complete and final disposition of all claims on account of the incident, injury, or injuries referred to therein, and the board shall not be authorized to enter upon any award subsequent to such board approval amending, modifying, or changing in any manner the settlement, nor shall the settlement be subject to review by the board under Code Section 34-9-104.</p>

              <p>The board or any party to the settlement agreement may require that the settlement documents contain language which prorates the lump sum settlement over the life expectancy of the injured worker. When such an agreement has been approved, neither the weekly compensation rate paid throughout the case nor the maximum statutory weekly rate applicable to the injury shall apply. No compensation rate shall exceed the maximum statutory weekly rate as of the date of injury. Instead, the prorated rate set forth in the approved settlement documents shall control and become the rate for that case. This subsection shall be retroactive in effect.

              <p>The board may make rules, not inconsistent with this chapter, for carrying out this chapter. Processes and procedure under this chapter shall be as summary and simple as reasonably possible; provided, however, that, in any proceeding under this chapter where the parties are represented by counsel, the board may require, by rule or regulation, on forms provided by the board, the filing of statements of contentions and points of agreement. The board may promulgate policies, rules, and regulations concerning the electronic submission to and transmission from the board of documents and filings. The board, any member of the board, or any administrative law judge shall have the power for the purposes of this chapter to issue and enforce subpoenas, to administer or cause to have administered oaths, and to examine or cause to be examined such parts of the books and records of the parties to a proceeding as relate to questions in dispute.

The board shall not, however, have the power to order imprisonment as a means of enforcing a subpoena. The board shall have the power to issue writs of fieri facias in order to collect fines imposed pursuant to this Code section and such writs may be enforced in the same manner as a similar writ issued by a superior court.</p>

Such proration shall be on the basis, in the case of the insurers, of the gross earned premium and, in the case of self-insurers, on the basis of the amount of premium which they would have had to pay in the event they had insured their liability with an insurer; provided, however, the board may establish by rule a minimum assessment, based upon the administrative cost necessary to provide licensure support and basic computer management reports for each insurer or self-insurer, to be paid by insurers and self-insurers whose actual prorated assessment otherwise would be less than the minimum assessment. Prorated assessments based on the experience of the previous calendar year shall be made on July 1, based on the budget of the board for that fiscal year.</p>

In the latter case, the board may, in its discretion, require the deposit of acceptable security, indemnity, or bond to secure the payment of compensation liabilities as they are incurred; provided, however, that it shall be satisfactory proof of the employer's financial ability to pay the compensation directly in the amount and manner when due, as provided for in this chapter, and the equivalent of acceptable security, indemnity, or bond to secure the payment of compensation liabilities as they are incurred, if the employer shall show the board that such employer is a member of a mutual insurance company duly licensed to do business in this state by the Commissioner of Insurance, as provided by the laws of this state, or of an association or group of employers so licensed and as such is exchanging contracts of insurance with the employers of this and other states through a medium specified and located in their agreements with each other, but this proviso shall in no way restrict or qualify the right of self-insurance as authorized in this Code section.

The annual license of such company shall not be issued or renewed until it has filed with the Commissioner of Insurance of this state the bond required by this Code section. In lieu of such bond a deposit of the same amount may be made with the Office of the State Treasurer in the form of other security satisfactory to the Commissioner of Insurance.

The board is authorized, of its own motion or upon complaint filed with it, after notice of not less than ten days and a hearing thereon, to revoke any permit granted under Code Section 34-9-131 if an employer is ready, willing, and able to pay a premium at the rate prescribed by the Insurance Department but it appears that the holder of such permit declines to accept and underwrite the risk assigned to it by the board or a bureau established and approved for rating purposes; or if it appears that the holder of any such permit fails and refuses to obey any valid order of the board or to pay any award entered against it by the board and not appealed from or affirmed on appeal; or if it appears that the holder of such permit is otherwise not qualified to carry on such business.

In formulating this method of assignment, a minimum loss ratio will be considered by the Commissioner of Insurance. Then, such established or approved method shall immediately assign an insurer to write such risk. The Commissioner of Insurance shall establish separate categories of risks rejected as the result of insufficient prior workers' compensation experience, risks rejected for factors other than workers' compensation loss experience, and risks rejected as the result of poor workers' compensation experience. Where such assignment has been made under the aforementioned method, the board shall not make the assignment.</p>

            <p>§ 34-9-150. Purpose of article
It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide an alternative mechanism through which bona fide members of trade associations and professional associations as well as groups of municipalities, counties, school boards, and hospital authorities may extend workers' compensation benefits to their employees through group self-insurance programs. This alternative is authorized to enable the members of these groups to lower workers' compensation costs by reducing administrative expenses and to encourage a reduction in claims through active loss prevention, loss control, and rehabilitation programs. It is therefore intended that this article be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.

            <p>§ 34-9-159. Annual reports of affairs and operations of funds; additional periodic reports; verification of reports; compliance condition for renewal of certificates
On or before March 1 in each year after it shall have commenced to do business pursuant to a certificate of authority, every fund shall make and file with the Commissioner a report of its affairs and operations during the last preceding calendar year. This annual report shall be made in such form and shall contain such information as the Commissioner may, from time to time, by regulation, prescribe and require to protect the public interest, the interests of the members of the fund, and the interests of the employees of each member. The Commissioner may, by regulation, require such additional periodic reports as the Commissioner may from time to time prescribe as necessary or appropriate to protect the members and their employees and the public, to ensure the solvency of any fund, to inform the members of the fund, and to assure fair dealing in the investments of any fund. The Commissioner may require that the reports be verified under oath by such appropriate officers or agents as the Commissioner may designate by regulation and may require the reports to be furnished to persons or entities the Commissioner determines to have a legitimate interest therein. The Commissioner may, based upon the Commissioner's evaluation of the condition of individual funds, exempt that fund from submitting any report, except the annual report required by this article. Compliance with this Code section shall be a condition of the renewal of a certificate of authority under Code Section 34-9-153.

            <p>§ 34-9-168. Grounds and procedure for restraining transaction of business by fund or administrator; appointment of receivers; criminal prosecution
If the Commissioner finds that any fund or its administrator (1) has failed to comply with any provision of this article, (2) is fraudulently operated, (3) is in such condition as to render further fund operations hazardous to the public interest or to the interests of the fund's members and their employees, (4) is financially unable to meet its obligations and claims as they come due, or (5) has violated any other provision of law, he may apply to the Superior Court of Fulton County for an injunction. The court may forthwith issue a temporary injunction restraining the transaction of any business by the fund; and, after a full hearing, it may make the injunction permanent and appoint one or more receivers to take possession of the books, papers, moneys, and other assets of the fund in order to settle its affairs and distribute its funds to those entitled thereto, subject to such rules and orders as the court may prescribe. If it appears that a crime has been committed in connection with the administration or management of any fund, the Attorney General may pursue the appropriate criminal action.

The Commissioner may use appropriated funds to conduct the examinations and shall provide by regulation for matters relative to the conduct of such examinations, including, without limitation, the expenditure of available funds for that purpose.

            <p>§ 34-9-260. Basis and method for computing compensation generallyExcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, the average weekly wages of the injured employee at the time of the injury shall be taken as the basis upon which to compute compensation and shall be determined, subject to limitations as to the maximum and minimum amounts provided for in Code Sections 34-9-261 and 34-9-265, as follows:
(1)  If the injured employee shall have worked in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury, whether for the same or another employer, during substantially the whole of 13 weeks immediately preceding the injury, his average weekly wage shall be one-thirteenth of the total amount of wages earned in such employment during the 13 weeks;

(2)  If the injured employee shall not have worked in such employment during substantially the whole of 13 weeks immediately preceding the injury, the wages of a similar employee in the same employment who has worked substantially the whole of such 13 weeks shall be used in making the determination under the preceding paragraph;

              <p>Compensation based on 66 2/3 percent of average weekly wages, subject to limitations of Code Section 34-9-261, shall be payable for loss of hearing caused by harmful noise, subject to the following rules which shall be applicable in determining eligibility, amount, and period during which compensation shall be payable:</p>

                <p>In the evaluation of occupational hearing loss, only the hearing levels at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 cycles per second shall be considered. Hearing losses for frequencies below 500 and above 3,000 cycles per second are not to be considered as constituting compensable hearing disability. No consideration shall be given to the question of whether or not the ability of an employee to understand speech is improved by the use of a hearing aid. The board may order the employer to provide the employee with an original hearing aid if it will materially improve the employee's ability to hear;</p>

                <p>The percentage of hearing loss shall be calculated as the average, in decibels, of the thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 cycles per second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric instruments, properly calibrated according to accepted national standards such as International Standards Organization (ISO) or American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), shall be used for measuring hearing loss. If more than one audiogram is taken, the audiogram having the lowest threshold will be used to calculate occupational hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 25 decibels or less in the four frequencies, such losses of hearing shall not constitute any compensable hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 92 decibels or more in the four frequencies, then the same shall constitute and be total or 100 percent compensable hearing loss. In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest measured losses in each of the four frequencies shall be added together and divided by four to determine the average decibel loss. For each decibel of loss exceeding 25 decibels an allowance of 1 1/2 percent shall be made up to the maximum of 100 percent which is reached at 92 decibels. In determining the binaural percentage of loss, the percentage of impairment in the better ear shall be multiplied by five. The resulting figure shall be added to the percentage of impairment in the poorer ear, and the sum of the two divided by six. The final percentage shall represent the binaural hearing impairment;</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 34-9-266. Payment of compensation for time loss, disability, or death resulting from hernia
In all claims for compensation for hernia resulting from injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employee's employment it must be definitely proved to the satisfaction of the board (1) that there was an injury resulting in hernia, (2) the hernia appeared suddenly, (3) the hernia was accompanied by pain, (4) the hernia immediately followed an accident, and (5) the hernia did not exist prior to the accident for which compensation is claimed. All inguinal, femoral, or other hernias which are proven to be the result of an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment shall be treated in a surgical manner by radical operation. If death results from such operation, the death shall be considered as a result of the injury and compensation shall be paid in accordance with Code Section 34-9-265. In nonfatal cases, time loss only shall be paid unless it is shown by special examination, as provided in Code Section 34-9-202, that the injured employee has a permanent partial disability resulting from the operation. If so, compensation shall be paid in accordance with Code Section 34-9-263. In the event the injured employee refuses to undergo the radical operation for the cure of the hernia, no compensation shall be allowed during the time such refusal continues. If, however, it is shown that the employee has some chronic disease or is otherwise in such physical condition that the board considers it unsafe for the employee to undergo such operation, the employee shall be paid as provided in Code Section 34-9-262.

            <p>§ 34-9-350. Purpose and construction of article
It is the purpose of this article to encourage the employment of persons with disabilities by protecting employers from excess liability for compensation when an injury to a disabled worker merges with a preexisting permanent impairment to cause a greater disability than would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone. It shall not be construed to create, increase, or provide any benefits for injured employees or their dependents not otherwise provided by this chapter. The entitlement of an injured employee or dependents to compensation under this chapter shall be determined without regard to this article, the provisions of which shall be considered only in determining whether the employer or insurer who has paid compensation under this chapter is entitled to reimbursement from the Subsequent Injury Trust Fund.

            <p>§ 34-9-351. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:(1)  "Merger of an injury with a preexisting permanent impairment" describes or means that:
(A)  Had the preexisting permanent impairment not been present, the subsequent injury would not have occurred;

(B)  The disability resulting from the subsequent injury in conjunction with the preexisting permanent impairment is materially, substantially, and cumulatively greater than that which would have resulted had the preexisting permanent impairment not been present, and the employer has been required to pay and has paid compensation for that greater disability; or

(C)  Death would not have been accelerated had the preexisting permanent impairment not been present.

(2)  "Permanent impairment" means any permanent condition due to previous injury, disease, or disorder which is, or is likely to be, a hindrance or obstacle to employment or to obtaining reemployment if the employee should become unemployed.

            <p>§ 34-9-352. Creation and authority of Subsequent Injury Trust Fund; state treasurer as custodian
There is established a Subsequent Injury Trust Fund which shall be of a perpetual, nonlapsing nature for the sole purpose of making payments in accordance with this article. The fund shall be administered by the administrator of the Subsequent Injury Trust Fund. All moneys in the fund shall be held in trust and shall not be money or property of the state. The board of trustees created by Code Section 34-9-354 shall be authorized to invest the moneys of the fund in the same manner as provided by law for investments by domestic insurers (Chapter 11 of Title 33). The board of trustees shall be authorized to designate the state treasurer as custodian of the fund for the purpose of investing the fund. In the event the state treasurer is appointed custodian he shall have exclusive control of the investment of the fund; and the trustees shall be absolved of any responsibility for such fund. The custodian shall be authorized to disburse moneys from the fund only upon written order of the administrator.
