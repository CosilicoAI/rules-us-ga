          <p>In addition to the license required in Code Section 43-4B-11, each professional boxer who is a resident of this state or another state which has no state boxing commission is required to register with a boxing registry created or designated by the commission and renew his or her registration as prescribed by rules of the commission. At the time of registration and renewal, the boxer shall provide the boxing registry with a recent photograph of the boxer and the social security number of the boxer or, in the case of a foreign boxer, any similar citizen identification number or boxer number from the country of residence of the boxer, along with any other information the commission requires. The boxing registry shall issue a personal identification number to each boxer and such number shall appear on the identification card issued to the boxer as a result of registration. Each boxer is required to present to the boxing commission an identification card issued by the state in which he or she resides not later than the time of the weigh-in for a professional match, contest, or exhibition. The commission may charge a registration fee in an amount calculated to cover the administrative expense of such registration.</p>
