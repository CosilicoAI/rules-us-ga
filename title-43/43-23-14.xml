          <p>Any partnership, firm, limited liability company, or corporation may engage in the practice of landscape architecture, as defined in this chapter, provided that any service which constitutes the practice of landscape architecture shall be supervised by a duly licensed landscape architect who shall be responsible for the services furnished by the partnership, firm, limited liability company, or corporation which would otherwise fall within the purview of this chapter. In no event shall the other members of the partnership, limited liability company, firm, or corporation be designated or described as landscape architects if they are not so licensed; and the term landscape architect or any abbreviation thereof or any other designation which conveys the meaning of landscape architect shall not appear in any partnership, firm, limited liability company, or corporate name in which any person is identified who is in fact not a licensed landscape architect. Upon approval of the board, any partnership, limited liability company, firm, or corporation may operate branch offices in this state to provide landscape architectural services, provided that each branch office has a resident landscape architect licensed under this chapter. All classified directory listings, advertisements, signs, and broadcast commercials, except letterheads and business cards, of corporations, firms, limited liability companies, or partnerships offering landscape architectural services shall include the name and license number of a duly licensed landscape architect providing such services.</p>
