          <p>Code Sections 34-8-83 through 34-8-85, to the extent that they relate to the Unemployment Trust Fund, shall be operative only so long as such trust fund continues to exist and so long as the secretary of the treasury of the United States continues to maintain for this state a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by this state for benefit purposes, together with this state's proportionate share of the earnings of the Unemployment Trust Fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals. If and when such Unemployment Trust Fund ceases to exist or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all moneys, properties, or securities therein belonging to the Unemployment Compensation Fund of this state shall be transferred to the treasurer of the Unemployment Compensation Fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release such funds, properties, or securities in a manner approved by the Commissioner in accordance with this chapter; provided, however, that such funds shall be invested in the bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of the United States of America and of the State of Georgia; and provided, further, that such investment shall at all times be so made that all the assets of the fund shall always be readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The Commissioner, as custodian, shall have the discretionary authority to dispose of securities or other properties belonging to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.</p>
