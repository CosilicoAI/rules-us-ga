          <p>Every common carrier by railroad shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier or, in case of death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving spouse or child or children of such employee; and if none, then of such employee's parents; and if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier or by reason of any defects or insufficiency, due to the carrier's negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment; provided, however, that there shall be no recovery under this Code section if the person killed or injured brought about his death or injury by his own carelessness amounting to a failure to exercise ordinary care or if he, by the exercise of ordinary care, could have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence. The measure of damages in case the injury results in death of the employee shall be that prescribed in Code Sections 51-4-1, 51-4-2, and 51-4-4; provided, however, that parties who may recover under this Code section, Code Sections 34-7-42 through 34-7-44, and Code Section 34-7-46 may sue and recover in their own names in the manner prescribed by Code Sections 51-4-2 and 51-4-4 in case no administrator or executor has been appointed at the time the action is filed. In case death shall result from injury to the employee, the employer shall be liable unless it, its agents, and its employees have exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence, the presumption being in all cases against the employer. If death shall not result from the injury, the presumption of negligence shall be and remain as provided by law in case of injury received by an employee in the service of a railroad company.</p>
