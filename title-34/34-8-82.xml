Such moneys shall be promptly replaced by moneys appropriated for such purpose from the general funds of this state to the Employment Security Administration Fund for expenditure as provided in Code Section 34-8-81. The Commissioner shall promptly report to the Governor, and the Governor to the General Assembly, the amount required for such replacement.</p>
