            <p>§ 9-10-1. Preference given to cases in which state is plaintiff
Where civil cases are pending in the superior courts, the Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court in which the state is a party plaintiff, preference shall be given to such cases over all other cases so pending; and the judges or Justices, as the case may be, shall use all the power vested in them by law to bring the cases to a speedy trial and, whenever required to do so by counsel for the state, shall take up the cases for trial and proceed to try the same, unless the defendant shows some good cause for continuance, when the case shall be continued to a future time in the same term, or to the next term, in the discretion of the court. Nothing in this Code section shall affect the right of the state to a continuance on a proper showing.

It shall be the duty of any judge of a court of this state, on or without motion, to continue any case in the court when the case is reached and any party thereto or his leading counsel is absent from the court by reason of his service in the armed forces when such service directly prevents his attendance in court or by reason of his attendance as a member of the National Guard upon any duty prescribed by the Governor or the adjutant general, unless the party, in the absence of his leading counsel, or the leading counsel, in the absence of the party, on the call of the case, announces ready for trial. If counsel is absent it shall be necessary for his client to make oath that he cannot safely go to trial without the absent counsel; and, if the party plaintiff or defendant is absent, his counsel shall state in his place that he cannot safely go to trial without the client.

   TO:  (Name of individual defendant or name of officer or agent of corporate 
defendant) as (title, or other relationship of individual to corporate 
defendant) of (name of corporate defendant to be served, if any)

   A lawsuit has been commenced against you (or the entity on whose behalf you 
are addressed). A copy of the complaint is attached to this notice. The 
complaint has been filed in the (court named on the complaint) for the State 
of Georgia in and for the County of (county) and has been assigned (case 
number of action).

   This is not a formal summons or notification from the court, but rather my 
request pursuant to Code Section 9-11-4 of the Official Code of Georgia 
Annotated that you sign and return the enclosed Waiver of Service in order to 
save the cost of serving you with a judicial summons and an additional copy of 
the complaint. The cost of service will be avoided if I receive a signed copy 
of the waiver within 30 days (or 60 days if located outside any judicial 
district of the United States) after the date designated below as the date on 
which this Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons is 
sent. I enclose a stamped and addressed envelope (or other means of cost-free 
return) for your use. An extra copy of the Waiver of Service is also attached 
for your records. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR ATTORNEY REGARDING 
THIS MATTER.

   If you comply with this request and return the signed Waiver of Service, 
the waiver will be filed with the court and no summons will be served on you. 
The action will then proceed as if you had been served on the date the waiver 
is filed except that you will not be obligated to answer or otherwise respond 
to the complaint within 60 days from the date designated below as the date on 
which this notice is sent (or within 90 days from that</p>

              <p>of Code Section 9-11-4 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated requires certain parties to cooperate in saving unnecessary costs of service of the summons and the pleading. A defendant located in the United States who, after being notified of an action and asked by a plaintiff located in the United States to waive service of a summons, fails to do so will be required to bear the cost of such service unless good cause be shown for such defendant's failure to sign and return the waiver.

It is not good cause for a failure to waive service that a party believes that the complaint is unfounded, or that the action has been brought in an improper place or in a court that lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or over its person or property. A party who waives service of the summons retains all defenses and objections (except any relating to the summons or to the service of the summons), and may later object to the jurisdiction of the court or to the place where the action has been brought.

A defendant who waives service must, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve on the plaintiff's attorney (or unrepresented plaintiff) a response to the complaint and also must file a signed copy of the response with the court. If the answer is not served within this time, a default judgment may be taken against that defendant. By waiving service, a defendant is allowed more time to answer than if the summons had been actually served when the request for waiver of service was received.

              <p>Defenses; form of denials.  A party shall state in short and plain terms his defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If he is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, he shall so state, and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, he shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, he may make his denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs, or he may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as he expressly admits; but, when he does so intend to controvert all its averments, he may do so by general denial subject to the obligations set forth in Code Section 9-11-11.</p>

              <p>Affirmative defenses.  In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, and waiver. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleadings as if there had been a proper designation.</p>

In such cases, if the attorney for the plaintiff files with the complaint an affidavit in which the attorney swears or affirms that his or her law firm was not retained by the plaintiff more than 90 days prior to the expiration of the period of limitation on the plaintiff's claim or claims, the plaintiff shall have 45 days after the filing of the complaint to supplement the pleadings with the affidavit.

A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before or at the time of pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, he may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Code Section 9-11-56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Code Section 9-11-56.</p>

              <p>When defendant may bring in third party.  At any time after commencement of the action a defendant, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint to be served upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to him for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against him. The third-party plaintiff need not obtain leave to make the service if he files the third-party complaint not later than ten days after he serves his original answer. Otherwise he must obtain leave on motion upon notice to all parties to the action. The person served with the summons and third-party complaint, hereinafter called the third-party defendant, shall make his defenses to the third-party plaintiff's claim as provided in Code Section 9-11-12 and his counterclaims against the third-party plaintiff and cross-claims against other third-party defendants as provided in Code Section 9-11-13. The third-party defendant may assert against the plaintiff any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff's claim. The third-party defendant may also assert any claim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The plaintiff may assert any claim against the third-party defendant arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff, and the third-party defendant thereupon shall assert his defenses as provided in Code Section 9-11-12 and his counterclaims and cross-claims as provided in Code Section 9-11-13. Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, or for its severance or separate trial. A third-party defendant may proceed under this Code section against any person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to him for all or part of the claim made in the action against the third-party defendant.</p>

              <p>Amendments to conform to the evidence.  When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of the evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence.</p>

              <p>Supplemental pleadings.  Upon motion of a party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit him to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense. If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor.

If an infant or incompetent person does not have a duly appointed representative, he may bring an action by his next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.

              <p>Joinder of claims.  A party asserting a claim to relief as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim may join, either as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims, legal or equitable, as he has against an opposing party.</p>

              <p>Joinder of remedies; fraudulent conveyances.  Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to have set aside a conveyance fraudulent as to him without first having obtained a judgment establishing the claim for money.

              <p>Permissive joinder.  All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action. All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action. A plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief and against one or more of the defendants according to their respective liabilities.</p>

Misjoinder of parties is not ground for dismissal of an action. Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just. Any claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately.

              <p>Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and independent of one another or that the plaintiff avers that he is not liable in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants. A defendant exposed to similar liability may obtain such interpleader by way of cross-claim or counterclaim.

                <p>In general.  Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence;</p>

The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and shall show that the petitioner expects to be a party to litigation but is presently unable to bring it or cause it to be brought, the subject matter of the expected action and the petitioner's interest therein, the facts which the petitioner desires to establish by the proposed testimony and the petitioner's reasons for desiring to perpetuate it, the names or a description of the persons the petitioner expects will be adverse parties and their addresses so far as known, and the names and addresses of the persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the petitioner expects to elicit from each, and shall ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to take the depositions of the persons to be examined named in the petition, for the purpose of perpetuating their testimony.</p>

At least 20 days before the date of hearing the notice shall be served either within or outside the county in the manner provided for service of summons; but, if such service cannot with due diligence be made upon any expected adverse party named in the petition, the court may make such order as is just for service by publication or otherwise and shall appoint, for persons not served, an attorney who shall represent them and, in case they are not otherwise represented, shall cross-examine the deponent. The court may make such order as is just requiring the petitioner to pay a reasonable fee to an attorney so appointed.

              <p>Pending appeal.  If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of a trial court or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the court in which the judgment was rendered may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in the trial court. In such case the party who desires to perpetuate the testimony may make a motion in the trial court for leave to take the depositions, upon the same notice and service thereof as if the action were pending in the court. The motion shall show the names and addresses of persons to be examined, the substance of the testimony which the movant expects to elicit from each, and the reasons for perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by Code Sections 9-11-34 and 9-11-35; and thereupon the depositions may be taken before a certified court reporter, or as otherwise provided by the rules of the Board of Court Reporting, and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in this chapter for depositions taken in actions pending in court.</p>

The plaintiff's attorney shall sign the notice, and said attorney's signature constitutes a certification by him or her that, to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief, the statement and supporting facts are true. If a party shows that, when he or she was served with notice under this paragraph, he or she was unable through the exercise of diligence to obtain counsel to represent him or her at the taking of the deposition, the deposition may not be used against such party.</p>

Any party may arrange for a transcription to be made from the recording of a deposition taken by nonstenographic means. With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method to record the deponent's testimony in addition to the methods specified by the person taking the deposition.

                <p>Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or a governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Interrogatories may, without leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon any other party with or after service of the summons and complaint upon that party; provided, however, that no party may serve interrogatories containing more than 50 interrogatories, including subparts, upon any other party without leave of court upon a showing of complex litigation or undue hardship incurred if such additional interrogatories are not permitted.</p>

              <p>Option to produce business records.  Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, or from a compilation, abstract, or summary based thereon, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to the interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries.

                <p>Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or by his attorney; but unless the court shortens the time, a defendant shall not be required to serve answers or objections before the expiration of 45 days after service of the summons and complaint upon him. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission; and, when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may, subject to subsection</p>

              <p>Effect of admission.  Any matter admitted under this Code section is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Subject to Code Section 9-11-16 governing amendment of a pretrial order, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense on the merits. Any admission made by a party under this Code section is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission by him for any other purpose, nor may it be used against him in any other proceeding.

After the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine the facts and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.

              <p>Formal exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary. For all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action of the court and his grounds therefor; and, if a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection does not thereafter prejudice him.</p>

              <p>The court may direct that one or two jurors in addition to the regular panel be called and impaneled to sit as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors in the order in which they are called shall replace jurors who become or are found to be unable or disqualified to perform their duties. Alternate jurors shall be drawn in the same manner, shall have the same qualifications, shall be subject to the same examination and challenges, shall take the same oath, and shall have the same functions, powers, facilities, and privileges as the principal jurors. An alternate juror who does not replace a principal juror may be discharged. However, if the court deems it advisable, it may direct that one or more of the alternate jurors be kept in the custody of one or more court officers, separate and apart from the regular jurors, until the jury has agreed upon a verdict. If one or two alternate jurors are called, each party is entitled to one peremptory challenge in addition to those otherwise allowed by law. The additional peremptory challenge may be used only against an alternate juror, and the other peremptory challenges allowed by law shall not be used against the alternates.

              <p>The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact. In that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer or may submit written forms of several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate. The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue. If in so doing the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issues so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury. As to an issue omitted without such demand, the court may make a finding; or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accordance with the judgment on the special verdict.</p>

              <p>Motion for directed verdict; when made; effect.  A motion for a directed verdict may be made at the close of the evidence offered by an opponent or at the close of the case. A party who moves for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence offered by an opponent may offer evidence in the event that a motion is not granted without having reserved the right to do so and to the same extent as if the motion had not been made. A motion for a directed verdict which is not granted is not a waiver of trial by jury even though all parties to the action have moved for directed verdicts. A motion for a directed verdict shall state the specific grounds therefor. The order of the court granting a motion for a directed verdict is effective without any assent of the jury. If there is no conflict in the evidence as to any material issue and the evidence introduced, with all reasonable deductions therefrom, shall demand a particular verdict, such verdict shall be directed.</p>

              <p>Motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict -- When made; new trial motion.  Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Not later than 30 days after entry of judgment, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict; or, if a verdict was not returned, such party, within 30 days after the jury has been discharged, may move for judgment in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict. A motion for a new trial may be joined with this motion, or a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative. If a verdict was returned, the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed. If no verdict was returned, the court may direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed or may order a new trial.</p>

If the appellate court reverses the judgment, nothing in this Code section precludes it from determining that the appellee is entitled to a new trial or from directing the trial court to determine whether a new trial shall be granted.</p>

              <p>Upon motion made not later than 20 days after entry of judgment, the court may make or amend its findings or make additional findings and may amend the judgment accordingly. If the motion is made with a motion for new trial, both motions shall be made within 20 days after entry of judgment. The question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings may be raised on appeal whether or not the party raising the question has made in the trial court an objection to findings or a motion for judgment. When findings or conclusions are not made prior to judgment to the extent necessary for review, failure of the losing party to move therefor after judgment shall constitute a waiver of any ground of appeal which requires consideration thereof.

              <p>Judgment upon multiple claims or involving multiple parties.  When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</p>

              <p>When case in default; opening as matter of right; judgment.  If in any case an answer has not been filed within the time required by this chapter, the case shall automatically become in default unless the time for filing the answer has been extended as provided by law. The default may be opened as a matter of right by the filing of such defenses within 15 days of the day of default, upon the payment of costs. If the case is still in default after the expiration of the period of 15 days, the plaintiff at any time thereafter shall be entitled to verdict and judgment by default, in open court or in chambers, as if every item and paragraph of the complaint or other original pleading were supported by proper evidence, without the intervention of a jury, unless the action is one ex delicto or involves unliquidated damages, in which event the plaintiff shall be required to introduce evidence and establish the amount of damages before the court without a jury, with the right of the defendant to introduce evidence as to damages and the right of either to move for a new trial in respect of such damages; provided, however, in the event a defendant, though in default, has placed damages in issue by filing a pleading raising such issue, either party shall be entitled, upon demand, to a jury trial of the issue as to damages. An action based upon open account shall not be considered one for unliquidated damages within the meaning of this Code section.</p>

              <p>Opening default.  At any time before final judgment, the court, in its discretion, upon payment of costs, may allow the default to be opened for providential cause preventing the filing of required pleadings or for excusable neglect or where the judge, from all the facts, shall determine that a proper case has been made for the default to be opened, on terms to be fixed by the court. In order to allow the default to be thus opened, the showing shall be made under oath, shall set up a meritorious defense, shall offer to plead instanter, and shall announce ready to proceed with the trial.

The adverse party prior to the day of hearing may serve opposing affidavits. The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law; but nothing in this Code section shall be construed as denying to any party the right to trial by jury where there are substantial issues of fact to be determined.

              <p>Case not fully adjudicated on motion.  If on motion under this Code section judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel shall, if practicable, ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such proceedings in the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.</p>

Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith. The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits. All affidavits shall be filed with the court and copies thereof shall be served on the opposing parties. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this Code section, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this Code section, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.</p>

              <p>When judgment entered.  The filing with the clerk of a judgment, signed by the judge, with the fully completed civil case disposition form constitutes the entry of the judgment, and, unless the court otherwise directs, no judgment shall be effective for any purpose until the entry of the same, as provided in this subsection. As part of the filing of the final judgment, a civil case disposition form shall be filed by the prevailing party or by the plaintiff if the case is settled, dismissed, or otherwise disposed of without a prevailing party; provided, however, that the amount of a sealed or otherwise confidential settlement agreement shall not be disclosed on the civil case disposition form. The form shall be substantially in the form prescribed by the Judicial Council of Georgia. If any of the information required by the form is sealed by the court, the form shall state that fact and the information under seal shall not be provided. The entry of the judgment shall not be made by the clerk of the court until the civil case disposition form is filed. The entry of the judgment shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs. This subsection shall not apply to actions brought pursuant to Article 3 of Chapter 7 of Title 44, relating to landlord and tenant dispossessory proceedings.

              <p>Procedure; time of relief.  Reasonable notice shall be afforded the parties on all motions. Motions to set aside judgments may be served by any means by which an original complaint may be legally served if it cannot be legally served as any other motion. A judgment void because of lack of jurisdiction of the person or subject matter may be attacked at any time. Motions for new trial must be brought within the time prescribed by law. In all other instances, all motions to set aside judgments shall be brought within three years from entry of the judgment complained of.</p>

            <p>§ 9-11-61. Harmless error
No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

                <p>The applicant's attorney certifies to the court, in writing, the efforts, if any, which have been made to give the notice and the reasons supporting the party's claim that notice should not be required.
Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance, shall be filed forthwith in the clerk's office and entered of record, and shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 30 days, as the court fixes, unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. In case a temporary restraining order is granted without notice, the motion for an interlocutory injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and shall take precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character; when the motion comes on for hearing, the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for an interlocutory injunction; and, if he does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On two days' notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification; and in that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine the motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.</p>

              <p>Security.  As a prerequisite to the issuance of a restraining order or an interlocutory injunction, the court may require the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been enjoined or restrained wrongfully. A surety upon a bond or undertaking under this Code section submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as his agent upon whom any papers affecting his liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. His liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and such notice of the motion as the court prescribes may be served on the clerk of the court, who shall forthwith mail copies to the persons giving the security if their addresses are known.</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 9-11-70. Judgment for specific acts; vesting title
A decree for specific performance shall operate as a deed to convey land or other property without any conveyance being executed by the vendor. The decree, certified by the clerk, shall be recorded in the registry of deeds in the county where the land lies and shall stand in the place of a deed. In all other cases where a judgment directs a party to perform other specific acts and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may direct the acts to be done at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person appointed by the court; and acts when so done have like effect as if done by the party. The court may also in proper cases adjudge the party in contempt. If real or personal property is within the state, the court in lieu of directing a conveyance thereof may enter a judgment divesting the title of any party and vesting it in others; and the judgment has the effect of a conveyance executed in due form of law. When any order or judgment is for the delivery of possession, the party in whose favor it is entered is entitled to a writ of execution upon oral or written application to the clerk.

Unless local conditions make it impracticable, each court shall establish regular times and places, at intervals sufficiently frequent for the prompt dispatch of business, at which motions requiring notice and hearing may be heard and disposed of; but the judge at any time or place and on such notice, if any, as is reasonable may make orders for the advancement, conduct, and hearing of actions.

                                   COMPLAINT

   The defendant C.D., herein named, is a resident of       (street),      
(city),       County, Georgia, and is subject to the jurisdiction of this 
court.

                                      1.

   During all the times herein mentioned defendant owned and operated in 
interstate commerce a railroad which passed through a tunnel located at     
and known as Tunnel No.     .

                                      2.

   On or about June 1, 1966, defendant was repairing and enlarging the tunnel 
in order to protect interstate trains and passengers and freight from injury 
and in order to make the tunnel more conveniently usable for interstate 
commerce.

                                      3.

   In the course of thus repairing and enlarging the tunnel on said day, 
defendant employed plaintiff as one of its workmen and negligently put 
plaintiff to work in a portion of the tunnel which defendant had left 
unprotected and unsupported.

                                      4.

   By reason of defendant's negligence in thus putting plaintiff to work in 
that portion of the tunnel, plaintiff was, while so working pursuant to the 
defendant's orders, struck and crushed by a rock which fell from the 
unsupported portion of the tunnel and was (here describe plaintiff's injuries).

                                      5.

   Prior to these injuries, plaintiff was a strong, able-bodied man, capable 
of earning $          per day. By these injuries he has been made incapable of 
any gainful activity, has suffered great physical and mental pain, and has 
incurred expense in the amount of $      for medicine, medical attendance, and 
hospitalization.

   Wherefore, plaintiff demands judgment against defendant in the sum of $
         and costs.

                                   COMPLAINT

   The defendant C.D., herein named, is a resident of      (street),     
(city),      County, Georgia, and is subject to the jurisdiction of this 
court. (Add appropriate statement about domicile of remaining defendants.)

                                      1.

   On or about June 1, 1965, plaintiff issued to G.H. a policy of life 
insurance whereby plaintiff promised to pay to K.L. as beneficiary the sum of 
$10,000.00 upon the death of G.H. The policy required the payment by G.H. of a 
stipulated premium on June 1, 1966, and annually thereafter as a condition 
precedent to its continuance in force.

                                      2.

   No part of the premium due June 1, 1966, was ever paid and the policy 
ceased to have any force or effect after July 1, 1966.

                                      3.

   Thereafter, on September 1, 1966, G.H. and K.L. died as the result of a 
collision between a locomotive and the automobile in which G.H. and K.L. were 
riding.

                                      4.

   Defendant C.D. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of 
G.H., defendant E.F. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of 
K.L., and defendant X.Y. claims to have been duly designated as beneficiary of 
said policy in place of K.L.

                                      5.

   Each of the defendants, C.D., E.F., and X.Y., is claiming that the 
above-mentioned policy was in full force and effect at the time of the death 
of G.H.; each of them is claiming to be the only person entitled to receive 
payment of the amount of the policy and has made demand for payment thereof.

                                      6.

   By reason of these conflicting claims of the defendants, plaintiff is in 
great doubt as to which defendant is entitled to be paid the amount of the 
policy if it was in force at the time of death of G.H.

   Wherefore, plaintiff demands that the court adjudge:

(1)  That none of the defendants is entitled to recover from plaintiff 
the amount of said policy or any part thereof.

(2)  That each of the defendants be restrained from instituting any 
action against plaintiff for the recovery of the amount of said policy or any 
part thereof.

(3)  That, if the court shall determine that said policy was in force at 
the death of G.H., the defendants be required to interplead and settle between 
themselves their rights to the money due under said policy and that plaintiff 
be discharged from all liability in the premises except to the person whom the 
court shall adjudge entitled to the amount of said policy.

(4)  That plaintiff recover its costs.

                                      1.

   Defendant received the sum of $10,000.00 as a deposit from E.F.

                                      2.

   Plaintiff has demanded the payment of such deposit to him by virtue of an 
assignment of it which he claims to have received from E.F.

                                      3.

   E.F. has notified the defendant that he claims such deposit, that the 
purported assignment is not valid, and that he holds the defendant responsible 
for the deposit.

   Wherefore, defendant demands:

(1)  That the court order E.F. to be made a party defendant to respond to 
the complaint and to this counterclaim.

(2)  That the court order the plaintiff and E.F. to interplead their 
respective claims.

(3)  That the court adjudge whether the plaintiff or E.F. is entitled to 
the sum of money.

(4)  That the court discharge defendant from all liability in the 
premises except to the person it shall adjudge entitled to the sum of money.

(5)  That the court award to the defendant its costs and attorney's fees.

A copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with an act of Congress or statutes of this state may be filed in the office of the clerk of any court of competent jurisdiction of this state. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of the court in which the foreign judgment is filed. A filed foreign judgment has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, staying, enforcing, or satisfying as a judgment of the court in which it is filed and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.

              <p>Where any person other than the vendor or other than the holder or assignee of the purchase money or secured debt has a judgment against a defendant in execution who does not hold legal title to property but has an interest or equity therein, such plaintiff in execution may take up the debt necessary to be paid by the defendant in order to give the defendant legal title to the property by paying the debt with interest to date if due and interest to maturity if not due; and thereupon a conveyance to the defendant in execution or, if he is dead, to his executor or administrator shall be made by the vendor or holder of title given to secure the debt or, if dead, by the executor or administrator thereof. When the conveyance has been filed and recorded, the property may be levied on and sold as property of the defendant.</p>

            <p>§ 9-13-72. Release of property subject to execution
If the plaintiff in execution, for a valuable consideration, releases property which is subject to execution, the release shall be a satisfaction of the execution to the extent of the value of the property so released insofar as purchasers and creditors are concerned. However, nothing in this Code section shall apply to any such release made by the transferee of any execution issued for taxes due the state or any county or municipality therein or of any execution issued by any municipality on account of assessments made against real estate for street or other improvements. In all such cases the execution shall be discharged or satisfied only to the extent of the amount of taxes or other assessments owing by the parcel released.

The person claiming the property levied on, or his agent or attorney, shall give bond to the sheriff or other levying officer, with good and sufficient security in a sum not larger than double the amount of the execution levied, made payable to the plaintiff in execution. Where the property levied on is of less value than the execution, the amount of the bond shall be double the value of the property levied upon, at a reasonable valuation to be judged by the levying officer, conditioned to pay the plaintiff in execution all damages which the jury on the trial of the claim may assess against the person claiming the property in case it appears that the claim was made for the purpose of delay only.

            <p>§ 9-13-92. Affidavit of indigence
In all claim cases where claimants are unable to give bond and security as required in this article, the claimants may file, in addition to the oath required in Code Section 9-13-90, an affidavit as follows:
      "I, A.B., do swear that I do not interpose this claim for delay only; that I bona fide claim the right and title to the same; that I am advised and believe that the claim will be sustained; and that because of my indigence I am unable to give bond and security as required by law."
When the affidavit has been made and delivered to the levying officer, it shall suspend the sale in the same manner as if bond and security had been given.

Every juror on the trial of the claim of property either real or personal shall be sworn, in addition to the oath usually administered, to give such damages as may seem reasonable and just, in an amount not less than 10 percent of the amount due upon the execution when the value of the property in dispute exceeds the amount of the execution, or of the value of the property when the value of the property is less than the execution levied, to the plaintiff against the claimant in case it shall be shown that the claim was made for delay only. The jury may give a verdict in the manner aforesaid and judgment may be entered thereon against the claimant and his security for the damages so assessed and the costs of the trial.

Whenever a claim is dismissed for insufficiency or is withdrawn, the plaintiff in execution may have a case made up and submitted to the jury charging that the claim was filed for the purpose of delay. Upon proof of the same, defendant and claimant having the same power to resist the case as in claim cases where damages are claimed, the jury, under instructions from the court, may give damages as in cases where the claim is not withdrawn but is submitted for trial to the jury. The cases so submitted shall be tried at the time of the disposal of the claim if the parties are ready, but continuances shall be granted as in other cases.

When an execution is levied on personal property and an affidavit of illegality is filed thereto and the party filing the illegality desires to take or keep possession of the property, he shall deliver to the sheriff or other levying officer a bond payable to the levying officer, with good security in a sum equal to double the value of the property so levied upon, to be judged of by the levying officer, conditioned for the delivery of the property levied upon at the time and place of sale in the event that the illegality is dismissed by the court or withdrawn, which bond shall be recoverable in any court having cognizance thereof.

            <p>§ 9-13-129. Property subject to other executions; retention of sale proceeds to satisfy first execution; release of bond pro tanto
When an execution has been levied on property and an affidavit of illegality has been filed to stay proceedings thereon, the property so levied on shall be subject to levy and sale under other executions. The officer making the first levy shall claim, receive, hold, and retain the amount of the proceeds of the sale as the court deems sufficient to pay the execution first levied, including interest up to the time of the court at which the illegality shall be determined. Any bond given by the defendant on filing the affidavit shall be released and discharged so far as relates to the property sold.

            <p>§ 9-14-51. Effect of failure to raise grounds for relief in original or amended petition
All grounds for relief claimed by a petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus shall be raised by a petitioner in his original or amended petition. Any grounds not so raised are waived unless the Constitution of the United States or of this state otherwise requires or unless any judge to whom the petition is assigned, on considering a subsequent petition, finds grounds for relief asserted therein which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.

              <p>If an unsuccessful petitioner desires to appeal, he must file a written application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal with the clerk of the Supreme Court within 30 days from the entry of the order denying him relief. The petitioner shall also file within the same period a notice of appeal with the clerk of the concerned superior court. The Supreme Court shall either grant or deny the application within a reasonable time after filing. In order for the Supreme Court to consider fully the request for a certificate, the clerk of the concerned superior court shall forward, as in any other case, the record and transcript, if designated, to the clerk of the Supreme Court when a notice of appeal is filed. The clerk of the concerned superior court need not prepare and retain and the court reporter need not file a copy of the original record and a copy of the original transcript of proceedings. The clerk of the Supreme Court shall return the original record and transcript to the clerk of the concerned superior court upon completion of the appeal if the certificate is granted. If the Supreme Court denies the application for a certificate of probable cause, the clerk of the Supreme Court shall return the original record and transcript and shall notify the clerk of the concerned superior court and the parties to the proceedings below of the determination that probable cause does not exist for appeal.</p>

The right to bail and the amount of bond shall be within the discretion of the judge of the superior court in which the sentence successfully challenged under this article was originally imposed.

          <content>
            <p>§ 9-14-53. Reimbursement to counties for habeas corpus costs
Each county of this state shall be reimbursed from state funds for court costs both at the trial level and in any appellate court for each writ of habeas corpus sought in the superior court of the county by indigent petitioners when the granting of the writ is denied or when the court costs are cast upon the respondent, but such reimbursement shall not exceed $30,000.00 per annum total for each county. By not later than September 1 of each calendar year, the clerk of the superior court of each county shall send a certified list to The Council of Superior Court Judges of Georgia of each writ of habeas corpus sought in the superior court of the county during the 12 month period immediately preceding July 1 of that calendar year by indigent petitioners for which the granting of the writ was denied or for which the court costs were cast upon the respondent; and such list shall include the court costs both at the trial level and in any appellate court for each such writ of habeas corpus. By not later than December 15 of each calendar year, the council shall pay to the county from funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the operation of the superior courts the reimbursement as set forth in the certified list, subject to the maximum reimbursement provided for in this Code section. The list sent to the council as provided in this Code section shall be certified as correct by the governing authority of the county and by the judge of the superior court of the county. The council is authorized to devise and make available to the counties such forms as may be reasonably necessary to carry out this Code section and to establish such procedures as may be reasonably necessary for such purposes. This Code section shall not be construed to amend or repeal the provisions of Code Section 15-6-28 or any other provision of law for funds for any judicial circuit.

When any action ex contractu is brought in the superior or state court and the verdict of the jury, unreduced by setoff or payment pending the action, is for a sum under $50.00, the defendant shall not be charged with more costs than would have necessarily accrued if the case had been heard before a magistrate. The remainder of the court costs shall be paid by the plaintiff and may be retained out of the sum recovered by the plaintiff and, if that is insufficient, judgment shall be entered by the court against the plaintiff for the balance.

No costs or items of costs shall in any case be demanded by any officer unless they are itemized and endorsed as provided in this Code section.

              <p>When any civil action is brought against a judicial officer, other than an action for quo warranto, mandamus, or an action brought under Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States Code, and such action arises out of the performance of the judicial officer's official duties, the plaintiff shall be liable for all attorney's fees and expenses incurred in the defense of the action if the action is concluded in favor of the judicial officer, and the court finds that an attorney or party brought an action that lacked substantial justification or that the action, or any part of the action, was interposed for delay or harassment. As used in this Code section, "lacked substantial justification" means substantially frivolous, substantially groundless, or substantially vexatious. For purposes of this Code section, judicial officers shall include justices and judges of the appellate courts of Georgia and judges of the superior, state, probate, juvenile, magistrate, and municipal courts.</p>

If the action is filed against a judge or justice of an appellate court, the chief judge or justice shall assign the matter to a member of that court. The judge shall review the pleading, and, if the judge determines that the pleading shows on its face such a complete absence of any justiciable issue of law or fact that it cannot be reasonably believed that the court could grant any relief against any party named in the pleading, then the judge shall enter an order dismissing the pleading. An order dismissing the pleading shall be appealable in the same manner as an order dismissing an action.</p>

              <p>A forfeiture lien creates, upon filing, a lien in favor of the state as it relates to the seized property or to any named person or related entities with respect to such property. Such forfeiture lien secures the amount of potential liability for civil judgment and, if applicable, the fair market value of seized property relating to any civil forfeiture proceeding enforcing such lien. A forfeiture lien referred to in this Code section shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of the laws in this state pertaining to the type of property that is subject to the forfeiture lien. The state attorney may amend or release, in whole or in part, a forfeiture lien filed under this Code section at any time by filing, without a filing fee, an amended forfeiture lien in accordance with this Code section which identifies the forfeiture lien amended. The state attorney, as soon as practical after filing a forfeiture lien, shall furnish to any person named in the forfeiture lien a notice of the filing of the forfeiture lien. Failure to furnish such notice shall not invalidate or otherwise affect a forfeiture lien filed in accordance with this Code section.</p>

No action for a tort shall abate by the death of either party, where the wrongdoer received any benefit from the tort complained of; nor shall any action or cause of action for the recovery of damages for homicide, injury to the person, or injury to property abate by the death of either party. The cause of action, in case of the death of the plaintiff and in the event there is no right of survivorship in any other person, shall survive to the personal representative of the deceased plaintiff. In case of the death of the defendant, the cause of action shall survive against said defendant's personal representative. However, in the event of the death of the wrongdoer before an action has been brought against him, the personal representative of the wrongdoer in such capacity shall be subject to the action just as the wrongdoer himself would have been during his life, provided that there shall be no punitive damages against the personal representative.

          <content>
            <p>§ 9-2-62. Retraxit and dismissal or discontinuance distinguished
A retraxit differs from a dismissal or discontinuance in that a retraxit is the open, public, and voluntary renunciation by the plaintiff in open court of his action or cause of action. It is positive and conclusive of the plaintiff's right of action. Where a retraxit is entered by the plaintiff and a judgment is entered thereon by the defendant, the plaintiff's right of action shall be forever gone. A dismissal or discontinuance is negative, and the plaintiff may recommence his action on the payment of costs.

If any sheriff, clerk, or other officer fails to discharge any duty required of him by any provision of Title 5, upon petition the appellate court or the superior, state, or city court, as the case may be, may compel the performance of such duty by mandamus. No party shall lose any right by reason of the failure of the officer to discharge his duties when the party has been guilty of no fault himself and has exercised ordinary diligence to secure the discharge of such duties.

            <p>§ 9-6-40. Prohibition counterpart of mandamus
The writ of prohibition is the counterpart of mandamus, to restrain subordinate courts and inferior judicial tribunals from exceeding their jurisdiction where no other legal remedy or relief is given. The granting or refusal thereof is governed by the same principles of right, necessity, and justice as apply to mandamus; provided, however, that no writ of prohibition to compel the removal of a judge shall issue where no motion to recuse has been filed, if such motion is available, or where a motion to recuse has been denied after assignment to a separate judge for hearing.

Extensions shall be freely granted in cases involving complicated facts or accounts, complicated issues of law, or lengthy records, so as to allow adequate time for preparation of exceptions thereto. All applications for extensions of time must be made before the expiration of the period of time for filing exceptions as originally prescribed or as extended by previous order of the court.

In all law cases where an auditor is appointed, exceptions of fact to his report shall be passed upon by the jury as in other issues of fact, and in equity cases by the jury when approved by the judge. The burden of proving error in the report of the auditor shall be upon the party making the exceptions, who shall have the right to open and conclude the argument. In all cases where both parties file exceptions of fact, the party against whom judgment would be rendered if the report were approved shall be entitled to open and conclude the argument.

If the parties to a medical malpractice claim agree in writing to arbitrate the claim pursuant to this article, they shall file a petition in the superior court of the county where any party resides for an order authorizing the arbitration of the claim in accordance with this article and for the appointment of a referee for the arbitration. If the judge determines that the claim is a medical malpractice claim subject to this article, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for such order he shall issue an order authorizing the arbitration and appointing a referee. However, no agreement to arbitrate shall be enforceable unless the agreement was made subsequent to the alleged malpractice and after a dispute or controversy has occurred and unless the claimant is represented by an attorney at law at the time the agreement is entered into.

            <p>§ 9-9-70. Postponement of arbitration
When, upon the meeting of the arbitrators, either party is not ready for trial, the referee may postpone the hearing of the case to a future day, which day shall be as early as may be consistent with the ends of justice, considering all the circumstances of the case. If one party is not ready for trial at the time appointed for the hearing of the case and the party has previously required two or more postponements of the trial, the referee shall determine whether the arbitration panel shall nonetheless hear the case or whether another postponement shall be granted, the determination to be consistent with the ends of justice, considering all the circumstances of the case.
