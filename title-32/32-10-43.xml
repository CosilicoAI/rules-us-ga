          <p>Any holder of bonds or interest coupons issued under this article, any receiver for such holders, or indenture trustee, if any there be, except to the extent the rights given in this Code section may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of Georgia or granted in this Code section or under such resolution or trust indenture. Also, any holder of bonds or interest coupons issued under this article, any receiver for such holders, or any indentured trustee may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this article or by resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, rents, and other charges for the use of the project or projects; and, in the event of default of the authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any bond issue, the individual, receiver, or trustee specified in this Code section shall be subrogated to each and every right, specifically including the contract rights of collecting rentals, which the authority may possess against the board and the department or either of them or their respective successors; and, in the pursuit of their remedies as subrogee, such individual, receiver, or trustee may proceed, either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceedings due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged directly or indirectly to the benefit of the bond issue of which said individual, receiver, or trustee is representative. No holder of any such bond or receiver or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state; nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state. However, any provision of this article or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, any such bondholder or receiver or indenture trustee shall have the right by appropriate legal or equitable proceedings, including without being limited to mandamus, to enforce compliance by the appropriate public officials with Article VII, Section IV and Article III, Section IX, Paragraph VI(b) of the Constitution of Georgia; and permission is given for the institution of any such proceedings to compel the payment of lease obligations.</p>
