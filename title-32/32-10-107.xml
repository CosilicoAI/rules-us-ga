          <p>Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36, the "Revenue Bond Law." The petition for validation for conduit bonds issued pursuant to paragraph (8) of Code Section 32-10-63 shall also make any person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, or other type of private entity a party defendant to such action, if such person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, or other type of private entity has contracted or will contract with the authority to provide funds for the repayment of revenue bonds which are to be issued and are sought to be validated. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to the validity of such bonds and against the authority and against all other persons or entities, regardless of whether such persons or entities were parties to such validation proceedings.</p>

The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and against the authority issuing the same.".</p>
          <p>The 2021 amendment,
