Parties may not give jurisdiction to a court by consent, express or implied, as to the person or subject matter of an action. However, lack of jurisdiction of the person may be waived, insofar as the rights of the parties are concerned, but not so as to prejudice third persons.

                <p>To achieve a reduction in recidivism and symptoms of mental illness among mentally ill offenders in criminal cases and to increase their likelihood of successful rehabilitation through early, continuous, and intense judicially supervised treatment, any court that has jurisdiction over a criminal case in which a defendant has a mental illness or developmental disability, or a co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorder, may establish a mental health court division to provide an alternative to the traditional judicial system for disposition of such cases. A mental health court division will bring together mental health professionals, local social programs, and intensive judicial monitoring.</p>

                <p>Each mental health court division shall establish a planning group to develop a written work plan. The planning group shall include judges, prosecuting attorneys, sheriffs or their designees, public defenders, community supervision officers, and persons having expertise in the field of mental health.

The mental health court division shall combine judicial supervision, treatment of mental health court division participants, and drug and mental health testing. Defendants charged with murder, murder in the second degree, armed robbery, rape, aggravated sodomy, aggravated sexual battery, aggravated child molestation, or child molestation shall not be eligible for entry into the mental health court division, except in the case of a separate court supervised reentry program designed to more closely monitor mentally ill offenders returning to the community after having served a term of incarceration. Any such court supervised community reentry program for mentally ill offenders shall be subject to the work plan as provided for in this paragraph.</p>

Standards and practices shall include, but shall not be limited to, the use of a risk and needs assessment to identify the likelihood of recidivating and identify the needs that, when met, reduce recidivism. The Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia shall update its standards and practices to incorporate research, findings, and developments in the mental health court field. Each mental health court division shall adopt policies and practices that are consistent with the standards and practices published by the Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia.
(B)  The Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia shall provide technical assistance to mental health court divisions to assist them with the implementation of policies and practices, including, but not limited to, guidance on the implementation of risk and needs assessments in mental health court divisions.

(C)  The Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia shall create and manage a certification and peer review process to ensure mental health court divisions are adhering to the Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia's standards and practices and shall create a waiver process for mental health court divisions to seek an exception to the Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia's standards and practices.

              <p>This article governs trials of violations of county ordinances and ordinances of state authorities, which violations may be punished by incarceration or monetary penalty. Nothing in this chapter shall grant to any county or state authority more authority to enact or enforce such ordinances than the county or state authority has independently of this chapter. The punishment imposed for any ordinance violation shall not exceed a fine of $1,000.00 or six months' imprisonment or both, provided the judge shall probate not less than 120 days of any sentence imposed, except as otherwise provided by general law, and shall not exceed the maximum punishment specified by the ordinance. In the event a sentence is revoked, a defendant shall not serve more than 60 days in a county jail.</p>

              <p>The trial court may suspend the service of the sentence imposed in the case upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe for the payment of the fine, for performance of community service in lieu of a fine or incarceration, for the payment of restitution to a victim, or other condition relating to the underlying offense. Service of the sentence, when so suspended, shall not begin unless and until ordered by the court having jurisdiction thereof, after a hearing as in cases of revocation of probated sentences, because of the failure or refusal of the defendant to comply with the terms and conditions upon which service of a sentence was suspended. Service of all or any part of any sentence suspended upon such conditions may be ordered to commence by the trial court any time before the expiration of one year from the date of the sentence after a hearing and a finding by the court that the defendant has failed or refused to comply with the terms and conditions upon which service of the sentence was suspended.

            <p>§ 15-10-61. No right to trial by jury; right of removal to state or superior court
There shall be no jury trials in the magistrate court. Any defendant who is charged with one or more ordinance violations may, at any time before trial, demand that the case be removed for a jury trial to the state court of the county or to the superior court of the county if there is no state court. Such a demand shall be written. Upon such a demand the court shall grant the demand. Failure to so demand removal of the case shall constitute a waiver of any right to trial by jury which the defendant may otherwise have.

            <p>§ 15-10-201. Jury trials
There shall be no jury trials in the magistrate court. Any person charged with one or more misdemeanor violations of Code Section 16-9-20 may, at any time before trial, demand that the case be removed to the state court of the county or to the superior court of the county if there is no state court. Such demand shall be written. Upon such written demand the court shall grant the demand. Failure to so demand removal of the case shall constitute a waiver of any right to trial by jury which the defendant may otherwise have had and of any other right which could have been secured by such a demand.

            <p>§ 15-11-1. Purpose of chapter
The purpose of this chapter is to secure for each child who comes within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court such care and guidance, preferably in his or her own home, as will secure his or her moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare as well as the safety of both the child and community. It is the intent of the General Assembly to promote a juvenile justice system that will protect the community, impose accountability for violations of law, provide treatment and rehabilitation, and equip juvenile offenders with the ability to live responsibly and productively. It is the intent of the General Assembly to preserve and strengthen family relationships, countenancing the removal of a child from his or her home only when state intervention is essential to protect such child and enable him or her to live in security and stability. In every proceeding, this chapter seeks to guarantee due process of law, as required by the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Georgia, through which every child and his or her parent and all other interested parties are assured fair hearings at which legal rights are recognized and enforced. Above all, this chapter shall be liberally construed to reflect that the paramount child welfare policy of this state is to determine and ensure the best interests of its children.

            <p>§ 15-11-27. Physical and mental examinationsDuring the pendency of any proceeding under this chapter, the court may order:
(1)  A child to be examined by outside parties or private providers at a suitable place by a physician or psychologist; provided, however, that orders to perform an evaluation shall not be imposed upon any state agency or county government unless such state agency or county government has funds available for such evaluation; and

(2)  Medical or surgical treatment of a child suffering from a serious physical condition or illness which, in the opinion of a licensed physician, requires prompt treatment, even if the parent, guardian, or legal custodian has not been given notice of a hearing, is not available, or without good cause informs the court of his or her refusal to consent to the treatment.

          <content>
            <p>§ 15-11-35. Appeals
In all cases of final judgments of the juvenile court, appeals shall be taken to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court in the same manner as appeals from the superior court. However, no such judgment or order shall be superseded or modified except in the discretion of the trial court; rather, the judgment or order of the court shall stand until reversed or modified by the reviewing court. The appeal of an order granting a petition to terminate parental rights shall stay an adoption proceeding related to the child who is the subject of such order until such order becomes final by the conclusion of appellate proceedings or the expiration of the time for seeking such review. Except for proceedings in connection with an adoption, the court shall continue to conduct hearings and issue orders in accordance with this chapter while an appeal in a case is pending.

              <p>As part of a risk reduction program, a court may implement or adopt an early intervention program designed to identify children and families who are at risk of becoming involved with the court.

              <p>When any agency or entity participating in a protocol agreement identifies a child who is at risk of becoming a delinquent child, dependent child, or child in need of services, the agency or entity shall refer the case to a multiagency staffing panel. The panel shall develop a multiagency intervention plan for such child. Such child or his or her parent, or both, may be present during any review of such child's case by the panel. A child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian shall be notified of the intervention plan by the agency making the referral or by a person or entity designated by the panel to administer the program. The staff of the court, other than the judge, shall work with the other agencies involved to educate a child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian and such child on the importance of following the intervention plan and on the consequences if anyone is referred to the court. If an intervention plan is developed for a child and his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian consents to such plan, the failure to comply with the plan or any portion thereof may constitute the basis for a referral to DFCS.

                <p>Any juvenile court may establish a family treatment court division to provide an alternative to the traditional judicial system for the disposition of dependancy cases and for assisting superior courts with criminal cases referred to such division under Code Section 15-11-15. The goal of a family treatment court division is to:
(A)  Reduce alcohol or drug abuse and addiction for respondents in dependency proceedings;

(B)  Improve permanency outcomes for families when dependency is based in part on alcohol or drug use and addiction;

(C)  Increase the personal, familial, and societal accountability of respondents in dependency proceedings; and

(D)  Promote effective intervention and use of resources among child welfare personnel, law enforcement agencies, treatment providers, community agencies, and the courts.</p>

Standards and practices shall include, but shall not be limited to, the use of a risk and needs assessment to identify the likelihood of recidivating and identify the needs that, when met, reduce recidivism. The Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia shall update its standards and practices to incorporate research, findings, and developments in the family treatment court field.

(B)  The Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia shall provide technical assistance to family treatment court divisions to assist them with the implementation of policies and practices, including, but not limited to, guidance on the implementation of risk and needs assessments in family treatment court divisions.

(C)  The Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia shall create and manage a certification and peer review process to ensure family treatment court divisions are adhering to the Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia's standards and practices and shall create a waiver process for family treatment court divisions to seek an exception to the Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia's standards and practices. The Council of Accountability Court Judges of Georgia shall create a certification process to allow a court to demonstrate its need for additional state grant funds, as authorized by Code Section 15-11-52, for one or more part-time judges to operate a family treatment court division.

If the court dismisses the petition, the prosecuting attorney may seek to refile a petition alleging a delinquent act which would be a felony if committed by an adult if a child is later determined to be mentally competent. The prosecuting attorney may also seek transfer to superior court if a child is later determined to be mentally competent and otherwise meets all the requirements for transfer under Article 6 of this chapter.

              <p>In keeping with this article's purpose of assisting, protecting, and restoring the security of children whose well-being is threatened, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the mission of protection of the children of this state should have the greatest legislative and executive priority. Recognizing that the needs of children must be attended to in a timely manner and that more aggressive action should be taken to protect children from abuse and neglect, the General Assembly creates the Office of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children to provide independent oversight of persons, organizations, and agencies responsible for providing services to or caring for children who are victims of child abuse and neglect or whose domestic situation requires intervention by the state. The Office of the Child Advocate for the Protection of Children will provide children with an avenue through which to seek relief when their rights are violated by state officials and agents entrusted with their protection and care.

          <content>
            <p>§ 15-13-11. Rule absolute as lien on officer's property
When a rule absolute has been obtained against any officer for the payment of money, as provided in Code Sections 15-13-4 and 15-13-5, the rule shall constitute the same lien upon the property, both real and personal, of the officer as an ordinary judgment at law; and, if not punctually paid, the demand shall thereafter draw interest at the rate of 20 percent per annum. The plaintiff may have either an attachment or an execution issued upon the rule absolute and may have either of the processes returned and the other issued, at pleasure.

          <content>
            <p>§ 15-14-21. Purpose
It is declared by the General Assembly that the practice of court reporting carries important responsibilities in connection with the administration of justice, both in and out of the courts; that court reporters are officers of the courts; and that the right to define and regulate the practice of court reporting belongs naturally and logically to the judicial branch of the state government. Therefore, in recognition of these principles, the purpose of this article is to act in aid of the judiciary so as to ensure minimum proficiency in the practice of court reporting by recognizing and conferring jurisdiction upon the Judicial Council of Georgia to define and regulate the practice of court reporting.

              <p>Intent.  The General Assembly declares it to be the purpose of this Code section to promote the orderly transfer of the law enforcement power of the several counties of this state in connection with the expiration of the term of office of the sheriff and the taking of office of the newly elected sheriff. The interest of the State of Georgia requires that such transitions in the office of the sheriff be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the conduct of the peace-keeping functions of the several counties of this state. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the law enforcement power to a person not properly versed and trained in law enforcement and the operations of the office of sheriff is declared to be detrimental to the safety and well-being of the citizens of the several counties of this state and of the entire state. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriate training be required of sheriffs who are newly elected so as to avoid or minimize any disruption in the performance of the duties and responsibilities or the authority of the sheriffs of the several counties of this state. This training shall be generally devoted to contemporary law enforcement, investigation, judicial process, and correction practices and specifically shall be germane to the duties and operational functions of the office of sheriff in the several counties of this state. Further, the purpose of this Code section is to promote professionalism within the office of sheriff by ensuring the highest possible quality of law enforcement training is offered to each sheriff on an annual basis. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriate ongoing training be required of all sheriffs. This training shall be generally devoted to contemporary law enforcement, investigation, judicial process, and corrections practices and specifically shall be germane to the duties and operational functions of the office of sheriff in the several counties</p>

Such course of instruction shall be held every four years at a time to be designated by the Georgia Sheriffs' Association.

            <p>§ 15-16-51. Use of sheriff's office name
It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any sheriff's office or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the sheriff's office or a member thereof. Furthermore, the sheriff's office, which has provided quality law enforcement services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the sheriff's office, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any sheriff office's name or any term used to identify the sheriff's office or its members without the express permission of the sheriff. The provisions of this article are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.

            <p>§ 15-18-26. Taking money or thing of value in exchange for official actions; ground for impeachment
If a district attorney takes or agrees to take from any person money or any other valuable thing which is not authorized by law, the consideration whereof is a promise or undertaking to procure or to try to procure a finding by the grand jury of a "true bill" or "no bill" upon an indictment, or to make or not to make a presentment, or to postpone or delay a state case or an arrest, or to advise that it be done or how it may be done, and an indictment is handed down or a presentment is made to this effect, the district attorney shall be disqualified from further discharging his or her official duties until a trial is had upon the indictment or presentment. If the trial results in a conviction, he or she shall be fined and imprisoned, at the discretion of the court. Such a conviction is also a ground for impeachment. The disqualification shall continue until the adjournment of the next session of the General Assembly. It shall be the duty of the clerk of the court to certify immediately such proceedings to the Governor.

Such compensation and expenses shall be paid by the council from state funds appropriated or otherwise available for the operation of the office of district attorney, upon a certificate by the district attorney, or in the case of a district attorney pro tempore by the Attorney General, as to the number of days served or the expenses incurred. No person subject to the provisions of this Code section shall serve for more than 1,040 hours in any calendar year, and no such person shall be eligible for employee health benefits other than those available to him or her as a part of his or her retirement benefits or for any annual leave, any sick leave, or any other employee benefits available to a state employee except those which are available to him or her as a retired employee. In the event of any conflict, the provisions of Title 47 shall prevail over any provision of this Code section.

            <p>§ 15-18-31. Referrals to defensive driving programs
When a prosecuting attorney determines that prosecution of a traffic offense, or municipal ordinance involving a traffic offense, is or is not warranted, and regardless of whether a court order is entered for such offense or a referral is made to a pretrial intervention, pretrial release, pretrial diversion program, or other similar pretrial program, a prosecuting attorney may condition any other action regarding such offense upon the satisfactory completion of a defensive driving course or defensive driving program approved by the Department of Driver Services but shall not be authorized to mandate the completion of any other driving program.

          <content>
            <p>§ 15-19-11. Attorney's retainer; recovery for services rendered
Unless otherwise stipulated, one-half of the fee in any case is a retainer and is due at any time unless the attorney, without sufficient cause, abandons the case before rendering service to that value. In cases where he has rendered such service but cannot render the balance of service due to the act of his client, providential cause, election to office, or removal out of the state, he is entitled to retain such amount or a due proportion thereof if collected, or if not collected, to bring an action to collect it. Where no special contract is made, the attorney may recover for the services actually rendered.

          <content>
            <p>§ 15-19-12. Status of note or obligation given as fee when service not rendered; penalty for transfer
Attorneys are prohibited from collecting any note or other contract in writing given as a fee in any case in which they have failed to attend to in person or by some competent attorney from the time of employment until the rendition of judgment. Any such note or written contract shall be null and void unless the attorney holding it was, by contract, released from the duty of attending to the case for which it was given. The transfer of such note or obligation subjects an attorney to forfeit and pay to the person from whom the same was taken double the amount thereof, recoverable in any court having jurisdiction of the same, unless the person is saved harmless against all fees, costs, and other necessary expenses on account thereof.

            <p>§ 15-19-52. Lawful acts by parties involved; financial services advice; legal instruments; title papers
Nothing contained in this article shall prevent any corporation, voluntary association, or individual from doing any act or acts set out in Code Section 15-19-50 to which the persons are a party; but, in preparing and filing affidavits in attachments and prosecuting such proceedings, it shall be unlawful for the plaintiffs to act through any agent or employee who is not a duly licensed attorney at law. Moreover, no financial institution, as defined by Code Section 7-1-4, whose deposits are federally insured shall be prohibited from giving any advice to its customers in matters incidental to providing financial services nor shall any person, firm, or corporation be prohibited from drawing any legal instrument for another person, firm, or corporation, provided that it is done without fee and solely at the solicitation and the request and under the direction of the person, firm, or corporation desiring to execute the instrument. Furthermore, a title insurance company may prepare such papers as it thinks proper or necessary in connection with a title which it proposes to insure, in order, in its opinion, for it to be willing to insure the title, where no charge is made by it for the papers.

            <p>§ 15-20-8. Participants in legal aid; certification by dean; oath
When a law school legal aid agency has been approved as contemplated in Code Section 15-20-6, a third-year law student or staff instructor regularly enrolled may be certified as a participant therein and authorized to practice legal aid as an adjunct thereof in such form and manner as the judge of the superior court may prescribe, taking care that the requirements of this chapter and the good moral character of the student or instructor are properly certified by the dean of the law school. Before entering an order authorizing him to practice legal aid, the judge shall further require of the student or instructor an oath similar to the oath required by an attorney.

As to each third-year law student or staff instructor authorized to practice legal aid, there shall be kept on file in the office of the clerk of the superior court in the county where such authority is to be exercised the dean's certificate, the student's and instructor's oaths, and the judge's order as contemplated under Code Section 15-20-8. The authority to practice legal aid, as allowed under this chapter, shall extend for no longer than one year. If during this period any change occurs in the status of the student or instructor at the law school in which he was enrolled at the time of his original certification, that is, if the student or instructor ceases his enrollment at the law school, ceases his enrollment in that law school's legal aid agency, or otherwise is expelled or suspended from the law school, then any authority to practice legal aid shall terminate and be revoked.

Any claimant against the fine and bond forfeiture fund or the heirs, administrators, executors, personal representatives, or assigns of any officer holding any valid claim against the fund may extend the period of limitation for an additional seven years by filing with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the claims arose another statement or claim setting forth the amount claimed and that the claimant has been unable to collect the claim or balance of the claim out of the fine and bond forfeiture fund. The statement shall be approved by the judge of the superior court of the county in which the claim arose and recorded on the minutes of the court by the clerk. The claim shall show on its face that it is made for the purpose of extending the period of limitation. The claim shall be made and recorded within the original seven-year period in order for the period of limitation to be extended. The extension of the period of limitation shall be for a period of seven years after the claim made for the purpose of extending the limitation period has been filed and recorded. The original period of limitation may be extended only once.

In all criminal cases in which a county pays costs or fees to any officer of any court, the amount of the costs and fees so paid shall thereupon become a claim against the fine and bond forfeiture fund for the benefit of the county. The claim for the benefit of the county shall at all times take the same priority of payment as against the fine and bond forfeiture fund as though the claim or the costs and fees were still held by the officer who received the payment. Upon payment of the costs or fees, the county shall become subrogated to the rights of the officer regarding payment out of the fine and bond forfeiture fund, with all rights enjoyed by the officer to enforce same at any time.

The commission may accept and solicit federal funds granted by Congress or executive order for the purposes of this article as well as gifts and donations from individuals, private organizations, or foundations.

(A)  Whether the compensation structure of this state is adequate to ensure that the most highly qualified attorneys in this state, drawn from diverse life and professional experiences, are not deterred from serving or continuing to serve in the state judiciary, as district attorneys, and as circuit public defenders and do not become demoralized during service because of compensation levels;

(B)  The compensation paid as a county supplement to judges, district attorneys, circuit public defenders, and other staff associated with the courts;

(C)  The caseload demands of judicial officers, prosecuting attorneys, and public defenders and the allocation of such officials, including staffing resources and jurisdictional structure;

(D)  The skill and experience required of the particular judgeships or attorney positions at issue;

(E)  The time required of the particular judgeships or attorney positions at issue;

(F)  The value of compensable service performed by justices and judges, district attorneys, and circuit public defenders as determined by reference to compensation in other states and the federal government;

(G)  The value of comparable service performed in the private sector, including private judging, arbitration, and mediation, based on the responsibility and discretion required in the particular judgeship at issue and the demand for those services in the private sector;

(H)  The compensation of attorneys in the private sector;

(I)  The Consumer Price Index and changes in such index;

(J)  The overall compensation presently received by other public officials and employees; and

            <p>§ 15-23-5. Secretary-treasurers of boards; surety bonds
The secretary-treasurer of the board shall give a good and sufficient surety bond, payable to the fund in such an amount as may be determined by the board, to account faithfully for all funds received and disbursed by him or her. The premium on the bond shall be paid out of the fund in such county. A secretary-treasurer who is designated by a combined board of several counties as provided by Code Section 15-23-12 may satisfy the bonding requirement with one bond. If the secretary-treasurer is already bonded by virtue of being a state employee, such a bond as a state employee will satisfy the bonding requirement.

            <p>§ 15-23-10. Determination of need as prerequisite to establishment of programNo alternative dispute resolution program shall be established for any court unless the judge or a majority of the judges of such court determine that there is a need for such program in that court. The funding mechanism set forth in this chapter shall be available to any court, including the juvenile court, which, having determined that a court-annexed or court-referred alternative dispute resolution program would make a positive contribution to the ends of justice in that court, has developed a program meeting the standards of the Supreme Court of Georgia Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules and appendices. Pursuant to the standards set forth in the Supreme Court of Georgia Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules and appendices, the funding mechanism set forth in this chapter shall be available to court programs in which cases are screened by the judge or by the program director under the supervision of the judge on a case-by-case basis to determine whether:
(1)  The case is appropriate for the process;

(2)  The parties are able to compensate the neutral if compensation is required; and

(3)  A need for emergency relief makes referral inappropriate until the request for relief is heard by the court.

            <p>§ 15-23-12. Contracting by boards of several counties to combine funds; secretary-treasurer for combined fund; chairperson
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the board of trustees of each county fund is authorized by contract to combine such fund with the fund of any other county or counties within the same judicial circuit, within the same administrative district, or in any other combination which would foster an efficient use of available resources. Any such combined fund created by any such contract shall be administered by a board of trustees which shall be composed of the judicial members and the clerks who are members of the boards of trustees of each participating county fund without the participating attorney members thereof but with one practicing attorney appointed by the members of the combined board.  In the event two or more county funds are combined, the board of trustees of the combined fund may appoint a secretary-treasurer for the combined fund who shall perform such duties as may be provided by the combined board of trustees and who shall give bond in the same manner as provided by Code Section 15-23-5.  The combined board shall be chaired by the chairperson of one of the constituent county boards elected by the combined board as provided by contract. In the event two or more boards combine as provided in this Code section, the judges of the courts within such combined territory are authorized to combine programs for such courts to provide for the most efficient use of available resources in providing alternative dispute resolution programs.

              <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in a county where the county site is located in an unincorporated area of the county, the county governing authority may construct one or more permanent satellite courthouses within the county and designate each such structure as a courthouse annex or otherwise establish each such structure as an additional courthouse to the courthouse located at the county site. The judges of the superior court in such county may hold sessions of superior court and conduct all other superior court business at the additional courthouse locations or at the courthouse at the county site. One or more of the judges of the superior court must hold a session of superior court at the county site not less than twice each year. All actions taken by a superior court judge at any additional courthouse in accordance with this subsection shall be fully valid and binding as though taken and performed at the county site.

            <p>§ 15-6-20. Special terms
The judges of the superior courts may, in their discretion, hold special terms of court in any county within their respective circuits when the business requires it to close the dockets and may, in the exercise of a sound discretion, cause new juries to be drawn for the same or may order the juries drawn for the regular term to give their attendance upon such special terms. The judges are authorized to hold special terms of court for the trial of criminal cases or for the disposition of civil business, or both, in any county of their circuits, at their discretion, and either to compel the attendance of grand or trial jurors of a previous term or to draw new jurors, according to law.

Such clerks of superior court may be from any two counties in the state other than the county of the clerk of superior court under investigation. The members of any such committee shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in connection with an investigation. The funds necessary to conduct an investigation shall come from the funds appropriated to the executive branch of the state government.</p>

In any case where a clerk of superior court has been suspended for 60 days, the Governor may extend the period of suspension for an additional 30 days. Upon such recommendation, the Governor shall also be authorized to request the district attorney of the county of the clerk's residence to bring a removal petition against the clerk in superior court based upon the evidence reported by the committee. After the filing of such petition, a clerk of superior court is subject to being removed from office by the judge of the court for any sufficient cause, including incapacity or misbehavior in office. The charges must be exhibited to the court in writing, and the facts tried by a jury. The clerk shall be entitled to a copy of the charges three days before trial. In the event that the Governor determines that further investigation should be made, the Governor may then order additional investigation by the committee, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, other law enforcement agencies of this state, or any special committee appointed by the Governor for such purpose. During any period of suspension, the clerk shall continue to hold office; however, the chief deputy clerk shall perform the duties of the clerk of superior court or, in the absence of a chief deputy clerk, an interim clerk shall be appointed as provided in paragraph</p>

            <p>§ 15-9-47. Default judgments
Notwithstanding any provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 9, if in any case pending before the probate court an answer, caveat, or other responsive pleading has not been filed within the time required by law or by lawful order of the court, the case shall automatically become in default unless the time for filing the answer, caveat, or other responsive pleading has been extended as provided by law.  The petitioner at any time thereafter shall be entitled to verdict and judgment by default, in open court or in chambers, as if every item and paragraph of the petition or other pleadings filed in the matter were supported by proper evidence.  At any time before final judgment, the court, in its discretion, upon payment of costs, may allow the default to open for providential cause preventing the filing of required pleadings or for excusable neglect or where the judge, from all the facts, shall determine that a proper case has been made for the default to open, on terms to be fixed by the court. In order for the default to be thus opened, the showing shall be made under oath, shall set up a meritorious defense, shall offer to plead instanter, and shall announce ready to proceed with the hearing in the matter.

            <p>§ 15-9-60.1. Additional marriage license fee for Children's Trust Fund
In addition to any fees required in Code Section 15-9-60 for receiving marriage applications, issuing marriage licenses, and recording relative thereto, the judge of the probate court shall charge an additional fee of $15.00 for issuing a marriage license. No amount of this additional fee shall be paid into the Judges of the Probate Courts Retirement Fund of Georgia provided for in Chapter 11 of Title 47 or be used for the purpose of calculating retirement benefits for judges of the probate courts. Each judge of the probate court shall collect the additional fees for issuing marriage licenses as provided in this Code section and shall pay such moneys over to the Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority by the last day of the month there following, to be deposited by the authority into the general treasury. The authority shall, on a quarterly basis, make a report and accounting of all funds collected pursuant to this Code section and shall submit such report and accounting to the Office of Planning and Budget, the House Budget and Research Office, and the Senate Budget and Evaluation Office no later than 60 days after the last day of the preceding quarter.

            <p>§ 15-9-61. Payment of fees prerequisite to filing; affidavit of indigence
The judges of probate courts shall not be required to file any proceedings until the deposit specified in Code Section 15-9-60, relating to court costs of probate courts, has been deposited with the probate judge on account of cost, provided that the deposit shall not be required if the party desiring to file the proceeding is unable because of his indigence to pay the deposit and the party files with the probate court an affidavit to that effect. If the proceeding is dismissed or withdrawn or if the total cost incurred in the proceeding is less than the deposit required by Code Section 15-9-60, any of the sum remaining in the hands of the judge of the probate court shall be repaid. The deposit required to be filed by this Code section shall not affect any Code section or Act of the General Assembly which requires a deposit in excess or in addition to the deposit of cost required by this Code section. Nothing contained in this Code section shall be deemed to require the deposit of cost by the state, its agencies, or its political subdivisions.

            <p>§ 15-9-86. Verified petitions; notice and service thereof
Every application made to the judge of the probate court for the granting of any order shall be by verified petition in writing, stating the ground of such application and the order sought. Unless otherwise provided by law, if notice of the application, other than by published citation, is necessary under the law or in the judgment of the judge of the probate court, the judge shall cause a copy of the application, together with a notice of the time of hearing, to be served by the sheriff or some lawful officer upon each party who resides in this state and to be mailed by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to each party who resides outside this state at a known address, at least ten days, plus three days if mailed, before the hearing. An entry of such service shall be made on the original. In extraordinary cases, where it is necessary to act before such notice can be given, the judge of the probate court shall so direct the proceedings as to make no final order until notice has been given.
