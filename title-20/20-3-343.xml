Such revenues and assets may also include, to the extent specified in the resolution authorizing issuance of such bonds or other obligations or the trust indentures securing them and in accordance with all other resolutions, indentures, or contracts of the authority and in accordance with law, educational loans financed and held by the authority with funds made available to it pursuant to Subpart 3 of this part and revenues derived therefrom. Each obligation of the authority issued under this subpart shall contain on its face a statement to the effect that the authority shall not be obligated to pay the obligation nor the interest thereon except from the revenues or assets pledged therefor and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such obligation.</p>
