          <p>Any holder of revenue bonds or interest coupons issued under this part, any receiver for such holders, or indenture trustee, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this part may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of this state or granted under this part or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this part or by resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, rents, and other charges for the use of the project or projects, and, in the event of default of the authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any revenue bond issue, shall be subrogated to each and every right, specifically including the contract rights of collecting rental or installment payments of purchase price, which the authority may possess against any contracting county, city, or independent school district or system or political subdivision. In the pursuit of his or its remedies as subrogee, such individual, receiver, or trustee may proceed either at law or in equity by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceedings due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged directly or indirectly to the benefit of the revenue bond issue of which such individual, receiver, or trustee is representative. No holder of any such bond or receiver or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state; nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state.</p>
