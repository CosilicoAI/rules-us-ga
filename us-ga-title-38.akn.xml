            <p>§ 38-3-92. Legislative finding
It is the finding of the General Assembly that natural disasters and disasters created by human agency often arise suddenly and that cooperation among government agencies and volunteer service agencies is vital in coping with such emergencies. The General Assembly further finds that dedicated service by trained and experienced volunteers can help prevent loss and destruction of life and property and that it is in the interest of the state and the citizens of the state to allow certain state employees who are trained and experienced in disaster relief to provide such service for brief periods without loss of pay and benefits.

            <p>§ 38-3-93. Authorization for certain employees of state agencies to be granted leave from work with pay in order to participate in specialized disaster relief services
An employee of a state agency who is a certified disaster service volunteer of the American Red Cross may be granted leave from his or her work with pay for not to exceed 15 workdays in any 12 month period to participate in specialized disaster relief services for the American Red Cross, upon the request of the American Red Cross for the services of that employee and upon the approval of that employee's agency and coordinated through the director of emergency management, without loss of seniority, pay, vacation time, compensatory time, sick time, or earned overtime accumulation. The state agency shall compensate an employee granted leave under this Code section at his or her regular rate of pay for those regular hours during which the employee is absent from work. Leave under this article shall be granted only for the services related to a disaster occurring within this state or in a contiguous state which has a reciprocal statutory provision.

            <p>§ 38-3-150. Legislative findings
The General Assembly recognizes the extreme dangers present when the safety of our citizens requires first responders such as police and firefighters to evacuate or secure a building. To better prepare for responding to disasters, criminal acts, and acts of terrorism, the General Assembly intends to create a state-wide first responder building mapping information system that will provide first responders with information they need to be successful when disaster strikes. The first responder building mapping information system shall be developed for this limited and specific purpose and does not impose standards or system requirements on any other mapping systems used for any other purpose.

If the authority chooses to contract with the Department of Revenue to audit the financial and business records of any service supplier offering communication services capable of connecting 9-1-1 service, the contract shall be nonmonetary and any and all costs associated with the performance of such audits shall be considered paid for by the administrative fee retained by the Department of Revenue under Code Section 38-3-186. Under no circumstances shall the Department of Revenue retain any additional charges for the purpose of conducting such audits. Such audits shall apply only to charges required to be imposed and collected pursuant to Part 4 of Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 46 on or after January 1, 2019. Any audits other than those conducted by the Department of Revenue shall be conducted at the authority's sole expense. The Department of Revenue shall provide to the authority access to all of the department's collection data and records of monthly returns of service suppliers under this Code section. Except as provided by Code Section 38-3-190, such data and records shall not be used by the authority for any purpose other than audits under this Code section and shall otherwise retain any confidential status while in the possession of or use by the authority or others retained by the authority.</p>
