              <p>As used in this Code section, the term "guardian" means the guardian ad litem appointed by the probate court who may represent a single party or more than one party or a class of parties with common or nonadverse interests; provided, however, that the court may determine for the purpose of the particular proceeding that the natural guardian, if any, or the testamentary guardian, if any, or the duly constituted guardian of the property, if any, or the duly constituted guardian of the person, if any, has no conflict of interest and thus may represent for the purpose of the proceeding a party who is not sui juris, who is unborn, or who is unknown.</p>

              <p>When a party to a proceeding in the probate court is not sui juris, is unborn, or is unknown, that party shall be represented in the proceeding by a guardian. Service upon or notice to a guardian shall constitute service upon or notice to the party represented and no additional service upon or notice to such party shall be required. Waivers, acknowledgments, consents, answers, objections, or other documents executed by the guardian shall be binding upon the party represented.</p>

              <p>Whenever a guardian ad litem is appointed, the court may limit the appointment or may at any time for cause appoint a successor. Unless the appointment is limited by the court, the guardian ad litem first appointed with respect to any proceeding involving the administration of the estate shall continue to serve with respect to such proceeding on behalf of the party represented until a successor is appointed, the party represented becomes sui juris, or the court terminates the appointment.</p>

              <p>In every petition filed in the probate court, the petitioner shall specify the name of each party who requires a guardian and the name and address of any person who is acting as guardian of the party. A copy of the letters appointing the guardian shall be attached to the petition or the petition shall allege such facts as shall show the authority of such guardian to act; provided, however, that the probate court may take judicial notice of the issuance of such letters or of such authority.

            <p>§ 53-12-81. Limitations on creditors' rights to discretionary distributions
A transferee or creditor of a beneficiary shall not compel the trustee to pay any amount that is payable only in the trustee's discretion regardless of whether the discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution, including, but not limited to, health, education, maintenance, and support, and whether such trustee is also a beneficiary. This Code section shall not apply to the extent of the proportion of trust property attributable to the beneficiary's contribution.

            <p>§ 53-12-151. Deeds to interests in property
The owners of property located in this state or persons desiring to acquire beneficial ownership of such property may create by deed an estate therein and in the improvements made thereon and in the property to be acquired, for the benefit of themselves and such other persons, whether sui juris or not, who may contribute to the improvement or development or acquisition of the property and their assigns or transferees, provided that the deed creating the estate shall provide for the improvement or development of the property covered thereby or for the acquisition of the property and the trustee therein named, and his or her successor shall have some active duty to perform in and about the trust property or the management or control of the same. The deed creating the estate shall be recorded as provided in Code Section 53-12-152. When such an estate is created, the legal title to the property and all the property added thereto or substituted therefor shall vest and remain in the trustee named and his or her successor, in accordance with the terms of the deed, with all the powers conferred thereby upon the trustee, and shall not during the continuance of the estate pass to or vest in the beneficiaries. At the end of 25 years from the date of the deed creating the estate, the title to such of the property as may then belong to the estate shall vest in the beneficiaries; and, if the deed creating the estate so provides, a renewal of the estate may be made at the end of the 25 years, upon the terms and conditions and in the manner therein set forth, for a like period; provided, however, that in the alternative to the period of 25 years and the renewal thereof, if the deed so provides, the estate may be created for any period of time specified therein which does not extend beyond any number of lives in being and 21 years thereafter.

            <p>§ 53-12-154. Certificates of beneficial interest by trustees
When an estate is created pursuant to Code Section 53-12-151 and from time to time thereafter, the trustee shall issue such certificates of beneficial interest as may be provided for by the deed to the persons who are beneficially interested in the estate or who become so interested therein in accordance with the provisions of the deed. The certificates shall pass and be transferred as personalty and in the same manner as shares of stock in corporations and shall be subject to levy and sale under attachment or execution or any other process in like manner as shares of stock. The trustee or person in charge of the estate representing the trustee shall be subject to the same demand as that provided by Code Sections 9-13-58 and 11-8-112 for the levying officer to make upon the officers of a corporation. Persons having claims against the estate may enforce the same by action against the trustee thereof in like manner as actions against corporations, and service thereof may be perfected by serving the trustee, if a resident of this state, and if not, then by publication. The venue of such actions shall be the same as that of similar actions against private corporations, but neither the trustee nor the beneficiaries of the estate shall be personally or individually liable therefor except in cases where officers and stockholders of private corporations would be liable under the law.

            <p>§ 53-12-155. Duties and powers of trustees; resignation or removal; successor trustees
The trustee of a trust created under Code Section 53-12-151 shall have sole and exclusive management and control of the property, in accordance with the terms of the deed creating the estate. The exercise by the trustee of any power granted or conferred by the deed, including the power to lease, encumber, and sell, when exercised in accordance with the terms thereof, shall be as valid and effective to all intents and purposes as if the trustee was the sole and exclusive owner of the property in his or her own right. The trustee may resign or be removed and his or her successor may be appointed in the manner of and in accordance with the terms fixed by the deed creating the estate. The same rights, powers, and title over and to the property shall belong to and be vested in the new trustee as are conferred upon the original trustee by the deed creating the estate. The death of a trustee shall not operate to cast title upon his or her heirs, devisees, executors, or administrators, but the same shall vest in his or her successor, when appointed.

In addition to investments in any property, the trustee of a trust created under Code Section 53-12-151 may invest any funds of the trust estate in investments authorized by trustees under the laws of this state; provided, however, that the deed creating the estate may further limit or expand the powers and authority of the trustee with respect to investments, including the power to invest in property located outside this state.

            <p>§ 53-12-174. Attorney general or district attorney as representative of charitable beneficiaries
In all cases in which the rights of beneficiaries under a charitable trust are involved, the Attorney General or the district attorney of the circuit in which the major portion of trust property lies shall represent the interests of the beneficiaries and the interests of this state as parens patriae in all legal matters pertaining to the administration and disposition of such trust. The Attorney General or the district attorney may bring or defend actions, and, insofar as an action of this nature may be deemed an action against the state, the state expressly gives its consent thereto. The venue of such actions may be in any county in this state in which a substantial number of persons who are the beneficiaries of the trust reside. Process shall be directed to the Attorney General or to the district attorney of the circuit in which the major portion of the trust property lies. Service may be perfected by mailing a copy of the petition and process by the clerk of the superior court of the county in which it is filed to the Attorney General or to the district attorney of the circuit in which the major portion of the trust property lies. Any judgment determining rights under any charitable trusts shall be binding on the beneficiaries if the Attorney General or the district attorney of the circuit in which the major portion of the trust property lies is a party and is served as provided in this Code section.

              <p>Upon the appointment of an administrator, the right to the possession of the whole estate is in the administrator, and, as long as administration continues, the right to recover possession of the estate from all other persons is solely in the administrator. The administrator may recover possession of any part of the estate from the heirs at law or purchasers from them; but, in order to recover real property, it is necessary for the administrator to show, upon the trial, either that the property which is the subject of the action has been in the administrator's possession and without the administrator's consent is held by the defendant at the time of bringing the action or that it is necessary for the administrator to have possession for the purpose of paying the debts, making a proper distribution, or for other purposes provided for by law. An order for sale or distribution, granted by the judge of the probate court after notice to the defendant, shall be conclusive evidence of either fact.</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 53-4-3. Determination whether instrument is will
No particular form is necessary to constitute a will. To determine whether an instrument is a will, the test is the intention of the maker to be gathered from the whole instrument, read in light of the surrounding circumstances. If the intention is to convey a present interest, though the possession is postponed until after death, the instrument is not a will. If the intention is to convey an interest accruing and having effect only at death, the instrument is a will.

A will must be freely and voluntarily executed. A will is not valid if anything destroys the testator's freedom of volition, such as fraudulent practices upon the testator's fears, affections, or sympathies; misrepresentation; duress; or undue influence whereby the will of another is substituted for the wishes of the testator.

            <p>§ 53-4-44. Destruction or obliteration of will or material portion thereof
An express revocation may be effected by any destruction or obliteration of the will done by the testator with an intent to revoke or by another at the testator's direction. The intent to revoke shall be presumed from the obliteration or cancellation of a material portion of the will, but such presumption may be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence.

If a will is illegal in part, the part that is legal may be sustained; but if the whole will so constitutes one testamentary scheme that the legal portion alone cannot give effect to the testator's intention, the whole will shall fail.

          <content>
            <p>§ 53-4-58. Failure to provide for living child believed deadIf at the time of execution of the will the testator fails to provide in the will for a living child of the testator solely because the testator believes the child to be dead, the child is entitled to receive a share in the estate as follows:
(1)  If the testator had no other child living at the time the will was executed, an omitted child receives a share equal in value to that which the child would have received had the testator died intestate but only to the extent that any provision in the will to or for the benefit of the surviving parent of the omitted child is not thereby reduced; or

(2)  If the will contains testamentary gifts to one or more other children of the testator, an omitted child is entitled to receive the share of the estate that the child would have received had the testator included all omitted children with the children to whom testamentary gifts were made under the will and had given an equal share to each child. To the extent feasible, the interest granted an omitted child must be of the same character, whether legal or equitable, present or future, as that left to the testator's other children under the will. In satisfying the share for the omitted child, the shares of the other children shall abate ratably, preserving to the maximum extent possible the testamentary plan adopted by the testator.

          <content>
            <p>§ 53-4-59. Specific, demonstrative, general, or residuary testamentary gifts
Testamentary gifts may be specific, demonstrative, general, or residuary. A specific testamentary gift directs the delivery of property particularly designated. A demonstrative testamentary gift designates the fund or property from which the gift is to be satisfied but nevertheless is an unconditional gift of the amount or value specified. A general testamentary gift does not direct the delivery of any particular property. A residuary testamentary gift includes all the property of the estate that is not effectively disposed of by other provisions of the will.

Notice shall not be required in the case of a person whose interest, even though vested, cannot be possessed until the passage of time or the happening of a contingency. The probate court may, on motion, modify the notice required in the case of numerous beneficiaries of the same or similar class where the value of each testamentary gift is, or appears to be, nominal. Upon motion, the court may determine whether the interest of any beneficiary required to be notified under this subsection is adequately represented, including any contingent interest of a beneficiary, and if such representation is found to be inadequate, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent each beneficiary or order such other notice as may be appropriate to a beneficiary of a contingent interest. If a trustee named in the will indicates a refusal to represent the beneficiaries of the testamentary trust, the court may order that notice be given directly to the beneficiaries of the trust.</p>

            <p>§ 53-5-24. Unavailability of subscribing witnesses
When it appears that a will cannot be proved as otherwise provided by law because at the time the will is offered for probate one or more of the subscribing witnesses to the will is dead or mentally or physically incapable of testifying or otherwise inaccessible, the court may admit the will to probate in common or solemn form upon the testimony in person or by affidavit or by deposition of at least two credible disinterested witnesses that the signature to the will is that of the individual whose will it purports to be or upon other sufficient proof of such signature. This Code section shall not preclude the court, in its discretion, from requiring, in addition, the testimony in person or by deposition of any available subscribing witness or proof of such other pertinent facts and circumstances as the court may deem necessary to admit the will to probate.

Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties, or as owners of community property held in survivorship form and not as tenants in common.

A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity's principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the state listed as the owner's address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or a similar statute is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

            <p>§ 53-5-66. Designation of transfer in beneficiary form
The designation of a transfer on death beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form has no effect on ownership until the owner's death. A registration of a security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner or all the then surviving owners without the consent of the beneficiary.

          <content>
            <p>§ 53-5-67. Ownership of registered security after death
On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

              <p>A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests for registrations in beneficiary form and for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered transfer on death beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters "LDPS," standing for lineal descendants per stirpes. This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.</p>

              <p>Whenever a personal representative or temporary administrator is required to give bond, the probate court may order the personal representative or temporary administrator to post such bond for a period of time greater than one year, as may be appropriate in the circumstances.

If the value of an estate decreases, the probate court may permit a corresponding reduction in the amount of the bond, but this reduction does not affect the liability of the surety for prior waste or misconduct by the personal representative or temporary administrator.

            <p>§ 53-6-53. Personal representative qualified to serve without, or not otherwise legally required to give, bond
When a personal representative has qualified to serve without bond or is not otherwise required by law to give bond, the probate court, on its own motion or on the representation of any party in interest that the personal representative is mismanaging the estate, shall order the personal representative to appear and show cause as to why bond should not be given or the personal representative's letters revoked. The order shall be served in person on the personal representative at least ten days prior to the hearing. Failure to show cause shall authorize the court to require bond or to revoke the letters or to take any other action as may be necessary under the circumstances.

A temporary administrator may apply to the court for reasonable compensation after notice to interested parties in compliance with Chapter 11 of this title.

              <p>The duties and powers of the personal representative commence upon qualification. Such powers relate back to give acts performed by the personal representative prior to qualification that are beneficial to the estate the same effect as those acts performed after qualification. The personal representative may ratify and accept on behalf of the estate acts that are done by others that would have been proper acts for the personal representative. A personal representative is a fiduciary who, in addition to the specific duties imposed by law, is under a general duty to settle the estate as expeditiously and with as little sacrifice of value as is reasonable under all of the circumstances. The personal representative shall use the authority and powers conferred by law, by the terms of any will under which the personal representative is acting, by any order of court in proceedings to which the personal representative is a party, and by the rules generally applicable to fiduciaries to act in the best interests of all persons who are interested in the estate and with due regard for their respective rights.</p>

              <p>As part of the petition for letters testamentary or letters of administration or by separate petition, the beneficiaries of a testate estate or the heirs of an intestate estate may, by unanimous consent, authorize but not require the probate court to grant to the personal representative any of the powers contained in Code Section 53-12-261. With respect to any beneficiary or heir who is not sui juris, the consent may be given by the guardian. The personal representative of a deceased beneficiary or heir shall be authorized to consent on behalf of that beneficiary or heir. The grant of powers shall only be ordered after publication of a citation and without any objection being filed. The citation shall be sufficient if it states generally that the petition requests that powers contained in Code Section 53-12-261 be granted.

(1)  To borrow money and to bind the estate by the execution of a promissory note for money borrowed and to pledge any or all the property of the estate for the payment of such a promissory note by mortgage, trust deed, deed to secure debt, or other security instrument, for the purpose of paying any gift, estate, inheritance, income, sales, or ad valorem taxes due the United States, the state, or any municipality or county of the state which constitute a claim or demand against the estate; provided, however, that a personal representative who desires to borrow money shall file a petition with the probate court, setting forth the facts and specifying the amount to be borrowed, the purpose for which the same shall be used, the rate of interest to be paid, the property to be pledged as security and the period of time over which the loan is to be repaid and, upon notice and hearing of the petition, an order granting leave to borrow the money and encumber the estate shall be entered and such order shall be binding, final, and conclusive as to all interested parties;

(2)  To make contracts for labor or service for the benefit of the estate upon such terms as the personal representative deems best and all such contracts made in good faith shall be a charge upon and bind the estate whenever such contracts are approved by the probate court;

(3)  To fulfill, as far as possible, the executory contracts and comply with the executed contracts of the decedent, including contracts for the sale of land or bonds to make title to land, and shall have a corresponding right to demand the same of parties contracted with; provided, however, that if the personal skill of the decedent entered into the consideration of the contract and the decedent's death renders execution impossible, the contract, though entire, shall be considered divisible and closed at the decedent's death and any partial execution by the decedent shall authorize and require a corresponding compliance by the other contracting party;

(4)  To provide competent legal counsel for the estate according to the needs of the estate and, in such cases, either the personal representative or the attorney employed may, by petition to the probate court duly served on the other, obtain a judgment fixing the attorney's fees and expenses;

(5)  To continue the business of the decedent for the 12 months following qualification of the personal representative, after which the personal representative may petition for permission to continue the business under such terms and conditions as the probate court may specify; and

(6)  To petition the probate court for permission to perform such other acts as may be in the best interests of the estate.

Unless otherwise provided by will or relieved under Code Section 53-7-32 or 53-7-33, the personal representative shall prepare an inventory of all the property of the decedent. The personal representative shall file the inventory with the probate court and shall deliver a copy of the inventory to the beneficiaries of a testate estate or the heirs of an intestate estate by first-class mail within six months after the qualification of the personal representative. It shall not be necessary to mail a copy of the inventory to any beneficiary or heir who is not sui juris or for the court to appoint a guardian for such person. The time for filing the inventory may be extended by the probate court for good cause shown. The inventory shall state that it contains a true statement of all the property of the decedent within the knowledge of the personal representative and shall be verified in the same manner as a petition filed in the probate court. The inventory shall state that the inventory has been mailed to all beneficiaries or heirs who are entitled to receive the inventory and shall provide the name of any beneficiary or heir who has waived the right to receive the inventory, as provided in Code Section 53-7-32.

A testator may, by will, dispense with the necessity of the personal representative's making an inventory to the probate court or the beneficiaries or both, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or persons other than beneficiaries under the will. If a will was executed in another state and the will is valid in this state and under the laws of the state where the will was executed the personal representative would not have been required to file inventories or if the will otherwise expresses an intent to relieve the personal representative from all reporting requirements, such a will shall be construed as dispensing with the necessity of inventories in Georgia, provided the same does not work any injury to creditors or parties other than beneficiaries under the will. In all wills, regardless of the date of execution, relief from making inventory with the court shall also relieve the personal representative from sending a copy of the inventory to the beneficiaries.

            <p>§ 53-7-41. Notice for creditors to render accounts; failure of creditors to give notice of claims
The personal representative shall be allowed six months from the date of the qualification of the first personal representative to serve in which to ascertain the condition of the estate. Every personal representative shall, within 60 days from the date of qualification, publish a notice directed generally to all of the creditors of the estate to render an account of their demands. The notice shall be published once a week for four weeks in the official newspaper of the county in which the personal representative qualified. Creditors who fail to give notice of claims within three months from the date of publication of the personal representative's last notice shall lose all rights to an equal participation with creditors of equal priority to whom distribution is made before notice of such claims is brought to the personal representative, and they may not hold the personal representative liable for a misappropriation of the funds. If, however, there are assets in the hands of the personal representative sufficient to pay such debts and if no claims of greater priority are unpaid, the assets shall be thus appropriated notwithstanding failure to give notice.

Personal representatives are authorized to compromise, adjust, arbitrate, assign, sue or defend, abandon, or otherwise deal with or settle debts or claims in favor of or against the estate. A personal representative who declines to litigate any claim may assign the claim to a creditor or an heir of an intestate estate or a beneficiary of a testate estate for the purpose of prosecuting the claim at that person's own expense and, after reimbursement of the expenses to the creditor, heir, or beneficiary, any remaining proceeds shall be paid over to the personal representative for administration.

In the case of corporate securities, a personal representative may likewise retain the securities into which the securities originally received are converted or which are derived therefrom as a result of merger, consolidation, stock dividends, splits, liquidations, and similar procedures; and a personal representative may exercise by purchase or otherwise any rights, warrants, or conversion features attaching to any such securities. This Code section applies to all property held by a personal representative on March 28, 1961, under estates previously created, except that it shall not relieve a personal representative from liability for loss which had already accrued on or before March 28, 1961.</p>

At any time before the expiration of two years after letters or an order for year's support or an order that no administration is necessary is issued regarding the estate of the missing individual, any property received by any spouse or child or other purported heir or beneficiary of the missing individual may be recovered by the missing individual unless the property has been transferred for an adequate consideration to a bona fide purchaser, in which case the amount of the consideration received for such transfer may be recovered from the transferor. No action to recover any property from any spouse, child, or other purported heir or beneficiary or to recover any consideration received by such a person as a result of a transfer of property to a bona fide purchaser may be brought by a missing individual after the expiration of the two-year period set out in this Code section unless the missing individual is a minor, in which case the time for bringing such actions shall be extended to two years from the date the missing individual reaches the age of majority.

            <p>§ 53-9-7. Distribution of assetsBefore a distribution of any of the assets of the estate of a missing person is made to a spouse, child, or other purported heir or beneficiary within the two-year period set out in Code Section 53-9-6, such spouse, child, or other purported heir or beneficiary shall give security, to be approved by the probate court in such sum as the court shall direct but in no case less than the estimated value of the money or property distributed, conditioned that if the missing individual is in fact alive, the person giving security will deliver to the missing individual, on demand by such individual at any time within the two-year period, the assets received by the person giving such security or, if such assets have been transferred to a bona fide purchaser, the consideration received in such transfer, without interest. If any person entitled to receive such assets is unable to give security, the personal representative shall continue to hold such assets until:
(1)  Security is given;

(2)  The court orders the personal representative to deliver the assets to the person; or

(3)  The two-year period has expired,

      whichever occurs first, and in the meantime shall invest the assets in any investment that is authorized by law for personal representatives or that is authorized in the duly probated will of the missing individual and shall pay the income from such investments to the person or persons entitled to such assets quarterly or as otherwise directed by the court.

            <p>§ 53-9-14. Report of conservator; court order
The conservator shall within 60 days after appointment make a written report to the probate court setting forth the condition of the estate of the missing individual, together with a schedule of any debts that may be owed by the missing person, an estimate of the income from the estate and the expenses necessary to its preservation, a statement showing the names, ages, and condition of any individuals who may have been dependent on the missing person for support, and a recommendation as to how the estate should be distributed. The court, after considering the report and making any further investigation the court may deem necessary, shall make such order as will most effectively tend to provide for the support of any individuals who may have been dependent upon the missing individual for support and for the handling of the property, including any business or business interest, owned by the missing person. The order may provide for the payment of those debts of the missing person as the court deems just and proper. An order of an appropriate court may allow the conservator to engage in such estate planning dispositions of the missing person's property as are authorized by Code Sections 29-3-36 and 29-5-36. The order may be modified in the discretion of the court at any time upon petition by the conservator, any individual dependent upon the missing individual for support, the guardian of any such individual, or any person having an interest in the property or in any business of the missing individual.

If an individual domiciled outside this state is possessed of any interest in or claim to or against any real or personal property or cause of action located in this state and would, if a domiciliary, be deemed to be missing in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 53-9-10 or if a conservator or any person serving in a similar capacity shall have been authorized to handle the property of the individual in the jurisdiction in which the individual is domiciled, the probate court may appoint a conservator of all of the interests or claims or causes of action located in this state and give direction as to the conservation of the property and its use in the interest of the missing individual or that individual's dependents, obligees, or successors in interest. The court shall mold such order in aid of any similar orders from the jurisdiction in which the individual is domiciled, may appoint the domiciliary conservator as the conservator in this state, and may authorize delivery of property to the domiciliary conservator. Except as the court may otherwise direct, the proceedings shall conform to the provisions of Article 2 of this chapter.
