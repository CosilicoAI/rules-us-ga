The actuarial investigation shall also include consideration of the experience of the retirement system under its assumptions and a comparison of results with the previous actuarial investigations and may also include such other studies as may be necessary or desirable for the completeness and accuracy of the actuarial investigation. The actuarial investigation shall also include a valuation of the contingent assets and liabilities of the retirement system and a determination of the payments necessary to amortize over a stated period any unfunded accrued liability disclosed. As an exhibit to the actuarial investigation, the local retirement system board of trustees or other governing authority thereof shall attach a copy of all the provisions of the plan for the local retirement system, including the requirements and conditions for qualifying to participate, the nature of benefits under the plan, and the manner in which the local retirement system is funded.

            <p>§ 47-1-7. Powers of retirement, pension, or emeritus systems or funds with regard to agents employed to act as custodians of assets or investment advisers
The board of trustees or other person or body having the power to manage, invest, and reinvest the assets of any retirement, pension, or emeritus system or fund created under the laws of this state may authorize any agent, including a bank or trust company, employed to act as custodian of such assets or to act as an investment adviser and to make investments for such retirement, pension, or emeritus system or fund, provided that such agent has a nominee or nominees in whose name securities, including, without limitation, bonds, stocks, notes, and other evidence of title to intangible personal property, held by the agent may be registered, to register securities which are held under the terms of such agency in the name of the nominee or nominees, without mention of the agency relationship in the instrument evidencing such securities or on the books of the issuing entity. The records of such agent shall at all times clearly show that such securities are held in such agency capacity and shall indicate the beneficial owner of the securities. Such agent shall not be relieved of liability for the safe custody, control, and proper distribution of such securities or the income therefrom by reason of the registration of those securities in the name of any nominee. The authorization of any such agent to register securities in the name of such nominees shall be in writing and may contain such other restrictions as the board of trustees or other person or body charged with the management and investment of the assets of any such retirement, pension, or emeritus system or fund may deem appropriate.

            <p>§ 47-1-24. Benefits denied to beneficiary who murders or commits voluntary manslaughter of member of public retirement system
No person who commits or conspires to commit the murder or voluntary manslaughter of a member, retiree, or beneficiary under a public retirement system shall receive any refund of contributions or any benefit under the public retirement system upon the death of the member, retiree, or beneficiary, even though the person so killing or conspiring is a named beneficiary for such refund of contributions or benefit.  A plea of guilty or a judicial finding of guilt which is not reversed or otherwise set aside as to any such crime shall be prima-facie evidence of guilt for the purpose of applying the provisions of this Code section.  All rights, interests, and entitlements to any such refund of contributions or benefit shall go to the secondary beneficiary designated by the member, retiree, or beneficiary, if a secondary beneficiary is designated and is living, upon the death of the member, retiree, or beneficiary, but otherwise to the member's, retiree's, or beneficiary's estate.

              <p>Any qualified returning veteran desiring to establish creditable service for a period of qualified service shall so notify the board of trustees of the public retirement system or fund. The board of trustees shall calculate the amount of employee or member contribution which the returning veteran would have paid if he or she had been a member of the system or fund during the period of qualified service. If such contribution is based on the member's salary, the returning veteran's salary shall be deemed to be the rate the member would have received but for the period of qualified service or, if determination of such rate is not reasonably certain, the member's average rate of compensation during the 12 month period immediately preceding the period of qualified service or such lesser time as the member was employed. The returning veteran shall repay the amount so calculated as his or her employee or member contribution, which payment must be completed not later than three times the length of qualified service or five years, whichever period is shorter, computed from the date the returning veteran resumes employment. The board of trustees of any public retirement system may provide by rule for computing the amount of creditable service on payment of less than the total amount of employee contributions.</p>

              <p>of this Code section, a judge of the probate court or employee of the board may elect in writing, on a form to be provided by the board at the time the judge or employee becomes eligible to receive retirement benefits, to receive a monthly retirement benefit payable up to the date of the death of the designated survivor, which benefit shall be based on the judge's or employee's age at retirement and the age of the judge's or employee's designated survivor at that time and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the total retirement payment which would have been paid to the judge or employee under subsection</p>

In any event, the designated survivor shall be a person with whom the member has a familial relationship through blood, marriage, or adoption. Such actuarial equivalent shall be computed on the Group Annuity Table for 1951 using 5 1/2 percent interest. The spouse designated at the time of the judge's or employee's retirement shall be the only spouse who may draw these benefits.</p>

                <p>of this subsection, then, after the approval of the application for retirement, the following provisions apply:
(A)  If the member's designated survivor shall predecease the member, the member may, in writing on forms prescribed by the board and subject to approval by the board, revoke such option and thereafter receive during the member's lifetime a monthly retirement benefit commencing on the date on which the board approves such revocation, but not for any period prior to such approval, equal to the maximum monthly benefit which would have been payable to him had such option not been exercised;

(B)  If there is entered a final judgment of complete divorce between the member and the member's spouse who is the designated survivor, the member may, in writing on forms prescribed by the board and subject to approval by the board, revoke such option and thereafter receive during the member's lifetime a monthly retirement benefit commencing on the date on which the board approves such revocation, but not for any period prior to such approval, equal to the maximum monthly benefit which would have been payable had such option not been exercised; and

(C)  If, following the death of the member's spouse or the entry of a final judgment of divorce between the member and the member's spouse who is the designated survivor, the member remarries, the member may, in writing on forms prescribed by the board and subject to approval by the board, elect such option with respect to the member's new spouse. The joint and survivor benefit shall be determined as of the date of the election. No such election shall be made until the expiration of one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier.</p>

              <p>Any district attorney who is married shall pay into the fund an amount equal to 2 1/2 percent of his state salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of 19 years, for spouses' benefits coverage.  Such payment shall entitle his surviving spouse to receive from the State of Georgia, for life or until remarriage, a sum equal to 50 percent of the benefits which he was receiving on the date of his death, if retired at such time, or which he would have been eligible to receive had he retired as of that date if he had 19 years of creditable service as of the date of his death.  If such district attorney had completed spouses' contributions for at least ten years of creditable service as a district attorney, but for less than 19 years of creditable service as of the date of his death, his surviving spouse who is eligible for such benefits under this Code section shall be entitled to receive, for life or until remarriage, a sum equal to the amount determined by multiplying one-half of the benefit he would have been entitled to receive upon completion of 19 years of creditable service without change in the salary he was receiving at the time of his death times the fraction which his creditable service bears to 19 years.  Those members with more than 19 years of creditable service shall utilize the salary level of the most recent 19 years of service when determining the contribution for spouses' benefits.  Any member who was compensated by the fee system prior to 1969 shall pay the required 2 1/2 percent contribution for spouses' benefits on the basis of $9,000.00 per annum, if such fees were less than that amount, or on the basis of the actual fees received, if more than $9,000.00 per annum, up to a maximum of $18,000.00 as the basis for such contributions.  In addition to such contributions, a member obtaining spouses' benefits shall pay interest on such contributions at the rate of 5 percent compounded annually up to the date of payment of such contributions.

Upon the death of a district attorney emeritus who exercised such option, the spouse's benefit provided for in this subsection shall be paid to the surviving spouse in equal monthly installments for life or until the surviving spouse remarries.  The option for spouses' benefits for district attorneys emeritus provided for in this subsection must be exercised in writing to the board of trustees by not later than December 31, 1992.

            <p>§ 47-14-76. Right to withdraw dues; effect of withdrawal on membership and benefits; eligibility to rejoin the fund
Any member may withdraw the total sum, without interest, which he has paid into the fund. In order to become eligible to rejoin the fund and to receive any benefits under this chapter after such withdrawal, he must repay the entire amount which he has withdrawn, plus interest at 6 percent per annum. A member shall not receive credit for any service after such withdrawal unless he pays the dues which he would have paid had he been a member of the fund during such period of service, plus interest on such amounts at 6 percent per annum. If any clerk dies before being retired, the total amount, without interest, which has been paid by him into the fund shall be paid to his estate. If, after retiring, any clerk should die without leaving a surviving spouse and without having received the amount in benefits equal to the amount which he had paid into the fund, the difference, without interest, shall be paid to his estate. If after retiring, any clerk should die leaving a surviving spouse and such surviving spouse should thereafter die without having received the amount of benefits equal to the amount which had been paid into the fund less the amount received by such clerk before his death, the difference, without interest, shall be paid to his estate.

(1)  The member must have served a minimum of at least four years as a qualified and commissioned sheriff of a county in the State of Georgia during which time the member served as sheriff of the superior court of that county after and including January 1, 1961; provided, however, as applied to any person first or again becoming a sheriff and a member on or after July 1, 1988, the member must have served a minimum of at least eight years as a qualified and commissioned sheriff of a county as provided in this paragraph;

(2)  The member must have paid dues as required by this chapter;

              <p>At the time a member becomes eligible for retirement benefits, he or she shall choose one of three payment options for retirement benefits. The member must indicate his or her choice of payment options upon the application for retirement benefits filed with the secretary-treasurer. Upon approval of the member's application by the board, such member shall be paid retirement benefits in the form of a monthly sum of money determined in accordance with the option he or she has selected. The three payment options are as follows:</p>

              <content>
                <p>Option One shall be known as a "single life annuity" and shall provide retirement benefits for the life of the member only. If the member has no more than four years of service credited to such member under this chapter, the member shall be paid a benefit of $380.00 per month until the member's death. If the member has more than four years credited to such member under the provisions of this chapter, such member shall be paid a benefit of $380.00 per month, plus $95.00 per month for each additional year of service so credited to the member. If the member has additional service credit not totaling a full year, the further sum of one-twelfth of the amount paid per month for each additional year of service credit over four years shall be paid for each month of additional service so credited to the member; provided, however, that in no case shall such benefits exceed $2,850.00 per month; provided, further, that the board of commissioners shall be authorized to increase such benefits by an amount not to exceed 3 percent per annum based on the following factors:
(A)  The recommendation of the actuary of the board of commissioners;

(B)  The maintenance of the actuarial soundness of the fund in accordance with the standards provided in Code Section 47-20-10 or such higher standards as may be adopted by the board; and(C)  Such other factors as the board deems relevant.
Any such increase may be uniform or may vary in accordance with the time of retirement, length of service, age, nature of the retirement, or such other factors as the board of commissioners shall determine; provided, however, that no such increase shall be made to become effective within six months of the effective date of any increase in the maximum retirement benefit granted by the General Assembly through amendment of this Code section;</p>

                <p>Option Two shall be known as a "100 percent joint life annuity" and shall provide retirement benefits for the life of either the member or his or her spouse, whichever is the survivor. The monthly amount to be paid under this option shall be based on the member's age and that of his or her spouse at the member's retirement and shall be the actuarial equivalent of the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One.

                <p>Option Three shall be known as the "50 percent contingency life annuity" and shall provide for payment of a 50 percent benefit for the life of the surviving spouse. The amount to be paid under this option shall be based on the member's age and that of his or her spouse at the member's retirement and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly benefit which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Actuarial equivalents shall be computed using a current and accurate mortality table adopted by the board. When a retired member has elected Option Two or Option Three, in the event the spouse predeceases the retired member, the monthly retirement benefit payable to the retired member after the death of the spouse shall be increased to the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. In the event any such retired member remarries or has remarried after the death of the former spouse, the retired member may elect to begin receiving the applicable reduced retirement benefit of equivalent actuarial value and reestablish on behalf of the new spouse the same option which was applicable to the deceased former spouse, but such option on behalf of the new spouse may not be reestablished until one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA51, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions.</p>

In the event the retired member revokes the election, the retired member shall begin receiving the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. Benefits paid under Option One to a retired member following such revocation shall not be retroactive. In the event that the retired member remarries after divorce from the former spouse and the member elected to revoke Option Two or Option Three as provided in this paragraph, the retired member may elect to begin receiving reduced monthly retirement benefits of actuarial equivalence under either Option Two or Option Three. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA5 1, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions.</p>

            <p>§ 47-17-42. Membership of peace officers blinded in the line of duty before creation of the fund; payments required of such peace officers; disability benefits available
Any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any person who was totally blinded in the line of duty as a peace officer prior to the creation of the fund and who has been unable to serve as a peace officer since that injury is authorized to become a member of the fund, regardless of whether such person is now or hereafter a peace officer. If he elects to join the fund, he shall pay into it the amount which he would have paid had he joined the fund upon its creation and continued as a member since that time, which amount shall be determined by the board. Upon such payment he shall be authorized to receive the maximum disability benefits under Code Section 47-17-81 without the necessity of complying with any time limitations contained in that Code section.

For purposes of determining amounts to be paid to the secretary-treasurer, the amount of the fine or bond collected shall be deemed to include costs.

Sums remitted to the secretary-treasurer under this Code section shall be used as provided for elsewhere in this chapter.

Such member shall receive one year of creditable service for each year of service in the armed forces of the United States, provided that there shall be a limit of five years of credit for such service. If a member remains in the armed forces of the United States longer than five years, his membership shall be terminated at the end of such five-year period but shall be reinstated if he returns to work as a peace officer within six months after he ceases such service and if he has not engaged in any other type work within such six-month period.

              <p>At the time a member qualifies for retirement payments, such member must choose a payment option provided for in this Code section. A member shall become eligible to begin receiving benefits on the first day of the month following the month in which the member qualified for retirement and terminated active employment as a peace officer. A member shall present to the secretary-treasurer a completed application form for retirement benefits. The application shall contain such information as the board shall require. After approval by the board, the secretary-treasurer shall pay to such retired member a monthly sum based on the option chosen by the member. If a married member with a spouse then living is unable to choose an option provided for in this Code section and to complete an application form because of death, mental incompetency, or other providential cause, then Option Two shall become effective.</p>

              <p>Option One shall consist of a single life annuity payable in monthly payments for the life of the member only. The monthly payment under this option shall be an amount equal to $17.50 per month for each full year of creditable service and in the event the member shall have additional service credit not totaling a full year, the further sum of one-twelfth of the amount paid per month for each additional year of service credit shall be paid for each month of additional service credit, provided that the member either has at least ten years of membership service, or 15 years for members who become members on or after July 1, 2010, and is at least 55 years of age or has at least 30 years of creditable service, regardless of age. Such monthly benefit payment shall be paid on each full year and additional full months of creditable service up to a maximum of 30 years of total service. No member shall be eligible for benefits under this option until the member's official duties as a peace officer have been terminated, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and unless the member files an application for retirement benefits within 90 days from the date of the termination of the member's official duties as a peace officer, unless prevented therefrom for good cause. If such member shall qualify for retirement benefits in every respect except for completion of payment of monthly dues for the periods of time for which the member has received service credit, dues shall be deducted from the member's monthly benefit check until such dues have been paid in full. Any member who has at least ten years of membership service, or 15 years for members who become members on or after July 1, 2010, for which dues have been fully paid but who has not reached 55 years of age may cease paying monthly dues into the fund if the member's employment as a peace officer is terminated; and upon reaching 55 years of age the member may be eligible to receive retirement benefits under this option.</p>

The amount of monthly payment to be paid under this option shall be based on the date the member first becomes eligible to receive pension benefits (normal retirement date) and shall be computed so as to be actuarially equivalent to the monthly retirement payment which would have been paid to the member under Option One. Such actuarial equivalence shall be computed on the interest rate and mortality basis approved from time to time by the board, the age of the member, and, if applicable, the age of his or her spouse as of the date benefits are to commence or as of the date benefits would have commenced if the member had retired after first becoming eligible for full benefits, whichever is earlier.</p>

                <p>Under Option Two or Three, a retired member may revoke the election of any such option at any time after the entry of a final judgment of complete divorce from the retired member's spouse or the retired member may elect to continue under Option Two or Three for the benefit of the former spouse. Upon any such revocation, the retired member shall begin receiving the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One. In the event any such retired member remarries after divorce from the former spouse and the retired member elected to revoke Option Two or Three as provided in this paragraph, the retired member may elect to begin receiving the applicable reduced monthly retirement benefit of equivalent actuarial value and reestablish on behalf of the new spouse the same option which was applicable to the former spouse. Such actuarial equivalence shall be based on the age of the retired member and the age of the retired member's new spouse at the time of such election and shall be computed on the Mortality Table GA51, with projection, using interest at 6 percent per annum, with a five-year age setback for females and monthly payment annuity functions. The option on behalf of the new spouse may not be exercised until one year after the date of remarriage or until a child of the remarried couple is born, whichever is earlier.

(e.1)  When a retired member has elected Option Two or Option Three, then in the event the spouse predeceases the retired member, the monthly retirement benefit payable to the retired member after the death of the spouse shall be increased to the monthly retirement benefit which the retired member would have been entitled to receive under Option One.

                <p>Each employer shall cause 5 percent of the earnable compensation to be deducted from the salary of each member for each and every payroll period; but the employer shall not have any such deduction taken from the compensation of a member who elects not to contribute if he has attained 65 years of age or has completed 35 or more years of service. In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the employer may consider the annual rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period, and it may omit the deduction from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if the employee was not a member on the first or last day of the payroll period. In order to facilitate the making of deductions, the employer may modify the deductions required of any member but not by more than one-tenth of 1 percent of the annual compensation from which such deductions are to be made. Each employer shall immediately pay amounts deducted to the board of trustees, in such manner as the board of trustees shall prescribe, which amounts shall be credited by the board of trustees to the member's account in the annuity savings fund. Beginning July 1, 1980, the employee contributions required under this chapter shall be paid as provided in Code Section 47-2-54;</p>

            <p>§ 47-2-52. Employer's duty to deduct and report employee contributions; duty of chief fiscal officer to remit employee contributions; effect of failure to comply
Each employer responsible for the payment of compensation to contributing members shall deduct and collect from each member's salary the employee contributions required under the retirement system and shall make a monthly report of such actions in such manner and form as are required by the chief fiscal officer of his employer. Such deductions may be made from future payments or reimbursement check to the employer. It shall be the duty of the chief fiscal officer of each employer to make monthly remittance of employees' contributions to the board of trustees. Should any employer fail to collect employee contributions or to make reports as required in this Code section, the appropriate employer shall withhold all funds allotted to such employer until he has fully complied with this Code section.

In addition, such individual shall no longer be a member nor henceforth be eligible for membership.

              <p>Any other provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, any required employee tax for social security coverage not otherwise retained by employer fiscal officers shall be deducted from each Division A member's individual annuity savings account by the retirement system for payment of such required tax. If the member's annuity savings account is insufficient to cover the required amount of employee tax, it shall be the duty of the fiscal officer of his or her employer to deduct from the current salary of the member such amounts as are necessary for payment of the employee tax. For those members of Division A covered for social security, it shall be the duty of the fiscal officers of the various employers to retain from each of the 5 1/2 percent employee-7 1/2 percent employer contributions for retirement system purposes, 2 percent of the member's first $4,200.00 annual wages, such amount to apply toward the employee-employer tax required under the Social Security Act. Any additional rate of employee-employer tax for social security shall result in a corresponding increase in the amount of tax payable by the employee and employer. All employee-employer taxes required under the Social Security Act after December 31, 1956, shall be retained by the fiscal officers of the various employers and reported to the board of trustees in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board of trustees. In order to facilitate the making of deductions and to simplify the reporting thereof for those members of Division A covered for social security, the board of trustees shall adopt such tables of employer and employee contributions as will result in uniform monthly contributions to the retirement system throughout the year. Such tables as adopted by the board of trustees shall not be placed in effect prior to January 1, 1963.</p>

            <p>§ 47-2-92. Reestablishment of service credit after withdrawal of accumulated contributions from this retirement system or the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia; payments required to obtain credit
Any present member who has withdrawn accumulated contributions from either the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia or the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia, or both, may, after two years of service as a contributing member, reestablish the creditable service for which the member would have been eligible if the accumulated contributions had not been withdrawn, provided that the member repays into the retirement system an amount equal to the amount withdrawn, together with regular interest at the rate of 4 1/4 percent per annum from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment, which contributions and interest shall be placed in the participant's individual account in the annuity savings fund. Upon receipt of notice from this retirement system to the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia that a member has repaid to this retirement system contributions previously withdrawn from the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia, the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia shall pay an employer contribution plus regular interest into the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia. The amount of the employer contribution shall be 6 percent of the reported compensation of the member during membership in the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia.

                <p>(A) Upon written application to the board of trustees, any member in service who has reached 60 years of age or who has 30 years of creditable service may retire on a service retirement allowance, provided that he or she has at least five years of creditable service; provided, further, that if he or she became a member after July 1, 1968, he or she has at least ten years of creditable service. The effective date of retirement shall be the first of the month in which the application is received by the board of trustees, provided that no retirement application will, in any case, be effective earlier than the first of the month following the final month of the applicant's employment. Applications for retirement shall not be accepted more than 90 days in advance of the effective date of retirement. Separation from service pending approval of the retirement application shall not affect eligibility for a retirement allowance. The provisions of this subsection regarding the effective date of retirement shall apply to all persons making application for retirement on or after March 15, 1979, and to all persons who have made application prior to March 15, 1979, but to whom payments from the retirement system have not commenced as of that date. Each employer shall certify to the board of trustees the date on which the employee's employment is or will be severed.(B)  If the employee has not reached normal retirement age on the effective date of retirement, the employer shall certify that no agreement exists to allow the employee to return to service, including service as or for an independent contractor. Any return to employment or rendering of any paid service by such employee, including service as or for an independent contractor, for any employer within two consecutive calendar months of the effective date of retirement shall render the severance invalid, nullifying the application for retirement.</p>

For those members who are in service with the Uniform Division of the Department of Public Safety as an officer, noncommissioned officer, or trooper, officers and agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, conservation rangers of the Department of Natural Resources, or in the Department of Revenue as an alcohol and tobacco officer or agent, normal retirement age shall be the date the employee has reached 55 years of age, provided that he or she has at least ten years of creditable service.

            <p>§ 47-2-122. Vesting of rights to a retirement allowance despite early retirement; retirement allowance payable to such persons
Except as provided in Article 2 of Chapter 1 of this title, a member's accumulated contributions shall be 100 percent vested and nonforfeitable at all times. The right to a service retirement allowance under this chapter shall vest in any member who withdraws from service with at least ten years of membership service subsequent to January 1, 1954, although the member has not yet attained 60 years of age, provided that the member has not withdrawn the member's contributions. Such member shall become entitled to a service retirement allowance (1) upon filing an application as provided in Code Section 47-2-110 and (2) upon attaining the age of 60 or, at the member's option, at any time subsequent thereto after filing such application. The retirement allowance in the case of any such member shall be the monthly amount the member would have received had the member retired on the last day the member contributed to the retirement system and at that time had been the same age as when the member actually retired. If a member with vested rights dies before reaching age 60, the member's accumulated contributions shall be paid to the member's named living beneficiary, otherwise to the member's estate.

              <p>of this Code section to death allowances, computations of projected retirement allowances shall be made on the same basis as though option two had been in effect. In lieu of the amount of death allowance otherwise payable to the beneficiary under option two, the member, upon written request, may at any time elect a reduced level death allowance of equivalent actuarial value, which allowance is payable to the beneficiary during a period of years certain or to the estate of the beneficiary and during the lifetime of such named beneficiary thereafter. At the election of the member, in case of death of the beneficiary during a term of years certain, the balance of the years certain payments may be paid to the estate of the member; but if such beneficiary predeceases the member, the total amount of the member's contributions to the date of his or her death shall be payable to the member's estate. The method of determining the equivalent actuarial value shall be consistent with the actuarial method of determining the beneficiary's death allowance under option two.</p>

Should the disability beneficiary's earnings later be changed, the amount of the pension may be further modified, provided that the modified pension shall not exceed an amount which, together with the disability beneficiary's annuity and the amount earnable by the disability beneficiary, equals the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement.

            <p>§ 47-2-126. Restoration to service of disability beneficiary
If a disability beneficiary is restored to service, the retirement allowance of the beneficiary shall cease and the beneficiary shall again become a contributing member of the retirement system.  Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any prior service certificate or creditable service which was used to compute such a member's creditable service at the time of retirement shall be restored to full force and effect, and upon the member's subsequent retirement the member shall be credited with all service as a member.

                <p>of this subsection, any member in service who has at least 15 years of creditable service who becomes disabled in service before becoming eligible to receive a service retirement allowance may be retired on a disability allowance by the board of trustees, upon written application to the board of trustees by the member or his or her employer and upon certification by the medical board that he or she is medically or physically incapable of further performance of his or her duties in the position he or she held at the time his or her disability originated, that incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that he or she should be retired; provided, however, that the medical board shall not consider any evidence of such disability which is not submitted within 12 months after the date the member submits his or her first application for a disability retirement. The board of trustees may retire such member not less than 30 days nor more than 90 days after execution and filing of the written application.</p>

              <p>of Code Section 47-2-110 to undergo a medical examination, such examination to be made at a place designated by the board, by physicians designated by the medical board. The disability beneficiary may request such an examination. Should any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained retirement age refuse to submit to such medical examination, the pension of such disability beneficiary may be discontinued by the board of trustees until the withdrawal of such refusal; and should the refusal continue for one year, all rights of the disability beneficiary in and to a pension may be revoked by the board of trustees. Should the medical board report and certify to the board of trustees that a disability beneficiary is engaged in or is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between the disability beneficiary's retirement allowance and the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement, the board of trustees may reduce the disability beneficiary's pension to an amount which, together with the disability beneficiary's annuity and the amount earnable by the disability beneficiary, equals the earnable compensation used to calculate the disability retirement allowance at the time of retirement.

              <p>For purposes of calculating a survivor's benefit, any member who has at least 15 years of creditable service and who dies in service before becoming eligible for a service retirement shall be deemed to be eligible to retire forthwith without regard to age and to receive the equivalent of a service retirement allowance calculated upon the number of years of creditable service attained to the date of retirement and based upon his or her highest average monthly compensation during a period of 24 consecutive calendar months while a member of the retirement system.

              <p>In the application of this subsection to death allowances, computations of retirement allowances shall be made on the same basis as though option two had been in effect. In lieu of the amount of death allowance otherwise payable to the beneficiary under option two, the member, upon written request, may at any time elect a reduced level death allowance of equivalent actuarial value, which allowance is payable to the beneficiary during a period of years certain or to the estate of the beneficiary and during the lifetime of such named beneficiary thereafter. At the election of the member, in case of death of the beneficiary during a term of years certain, the balance of the years certain payments may be paid to the estate of the member; but if such beneficiary predeceases the member, the total amount of the member's contributions to the date of his or her death shall be payable to the member's estate. The method of determining the equivalent actuarial value shall be consistent with the actuarial method of determining the beneficiary's death allowance under option two.

(1)  "Accumulated retirement system benefits" means benefits that are attributable under the provisions of a retirement system to employees' service rendered to a specific valuation date.

(2)  "Actuarial accrued liability" means that portion, as determined by a particular actuarial cost method, of the actuarial present value of retirement system benefits and expenses which is not provided for by future normal costs.

(3)  "Actuarial assumptions" means assumptions as to the occurrence of future events affecting retirement system costs such as: mortality, withdrawal, disability, and retirement; changes in compensation and national pension benefits; rates of investment earnings and asset appreciation or depreciation; procedures used to determine the actuarial value of assets; and other relevant items.

(4)  "Actuarial cost method" means a procedure for determining the actuarial present value of retirement system benefits and expenses and for developing an actuarially equivalent allocation of such value to time periods, usually in the form of a normal cost and an actuarial accrued liability. Acceptable actuarial cost methods are the aggregate, attained age, entry age, frozen attained age, frozen entry age, and unit credit methods.

(5)  "Actuarial present value" means the value of an amount or series of amounts payable or receivable at various times from a retirement system, determined as of a given date by the application of a particular set of actuarial assumptions.

(6)  "Actuarial present value of accumulated retirement system benefits" means the amount as of a valuation date that results from applying actuarial assumptions to the accumulated retirement system benefits, with the actuarial assumptions being used to adjust those benefits to reflect the time value of money, through discounts for interest, and the probability of payment, by means of decrements such as for death, disability, withdrawal, or retirement, between the valuation date and the expected date of payments.

(7)  "Actuarial valuation" means the determination, as of a valuation date, of the normal cost, actuarial accrued liability, actuarial value of assets, and related actuarial present values for a retirement system.

(8)  "Actuarial value of assets" means the value of cash, investments, and other property belonging to a retirement system, as used by the actuary for the purpose of an actuarial valuation.

(9)  "Actuary" means an actuary who is enrolled under Subtitle C of Title III of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, P.L. 93-406, or an associate of the Society of Actuaries.

(11)  "Beneficiary" means a person receiving or entitled to receive a benefit pursuant to a retirement system.

(12)  "Benefit" means any benefit, including disability benefits, which is paid or payable to a beneficiary under a retirement system.

(13)  "Benefit increase" means a change in or amendment to a retirement system which results or will result in an increase in the benefits being paid or which will be paid to a beneficiary or potential beneficiary under a retirement system and includes any change in a retirement system which decreases the requirements for becoming eligible to receive a benefit and any change which grants or authorizes a member or members of a retirement system to obtain additional creditable service under the retirement system for service rendered in a capacity other than as a member of the retirement system.

(14)  "Employee" means officials and employees of the state or of any department, board, bureau, commission, authority, or other agency thereof and the officials and employees of a political subdivision or any agency thereof who are or who become members of a retirement system.

(15)  "Employee contribution" means that part of the compensation of an employee which is paid by or on behalf of an employee as a contribution to a retirement system.

(16)  "Employer" means the State of Georgia for any retirement system financially supported in whole or in part by appropriations made by the General Assembly, by the proceeds of a tax levied by law enacted by the General Assembly, or by fines and forfeitures or portions of fines and designated by law as a source of funding for a retirement system; and, for any retirement system supported in whole or in part by the funds of a political subdivision, "employer" means the local governing authority authorizing or providing for the local retirement system.(17)  "Employer contribution" means:

Any superior court judge or district attorney who is an active member of this retirement system may receive up to five years of creditable service for his or her past service as a circuit-paid assistant district attorney who was not eligible to participate in a local retirement plan upon payment to the board of trustees of an amount which will allow such creditable service without creating any accrued actuarial unfunded liability as to this retirement system. Any member desiring such creditable service shall make application to the board of trustees in such form as the board deems appropriate, provide such proof of eligible prior service as the board deems necessary, and make full payment not later than December 31, 2008, or within six months of first or again becoming a member, whichever is later. No creditable service shall be allowed under this Code section for any period of employment for which creditable service is allowed under any provision of any other retirement or pension system of this state or of any political subdivision of this state.

                <p>After the commencement date, each employer shall cause to be deducted from the salary of each member for each and every payroll period a percentage of the member's earnable compensation as determined by the board of trustees which shall be not less than 5 nor more than 6 percent; but no such deduction shall be made from the compensation of a member after the close of the school, fiscal, or contract year in which the member has attained age 65 and has completed 40 or more years of creditable service. In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the employer may consider the annual rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period. The employer may omit the deduction from compensation for any period which is less than a full payroll period, if a teacher was not a member on the first day of the payroll period. In order to facilitate the making of deductions, the employer may modify the deductions required of any member by an amount not to exceed one-tenth of 1 percent of the annual compensation, on the basis of which such deductions are to be made. Each employer shall immediately pay the amount deducted to the board of trustees, in such manner as the board of trustees shall prescribe, which amount shall be credited by the board of trustees to the individual accounts in the annuity savings fund of the member from whose compensation the deductions were made. Beginning July 1, 1987, the employee contributions required under this paragraph shall be paid as provided in Code Section 47-3-41.1;</p>

If such election is made, such teacher shall notify his employer and the board of trustees in such manner as the board of trustees shall prescribe.

Any member who has discontinued making contributions to the retirement system because he has attained age 65 and has 40 years of creditable service and who has continued in service may remit contributions to the board of trustees at the rate required by law and under terms and regulations prescribed by the board of trustees on all earnable compensation received by the member since deductions were discontinued.

            <p>§ 47-3-48. Certification to employers of normal and accrued liability contribution rates; estimates by employers of contributions for coming year; requests for appropriations
Thirty days prior to the time the State Board of Education fixes the minimum schedule of teachers' salaries for the ensuing year, the normal and accrued contribution rates, as determined on the basis of the last annual actuarial valuation, shall be certified by the board of trustees to each employer having members in its employ. Each such employer other than the state shall include in its budget filed with the State School Superintendent amounts equal to the prospective contributions on account of contributing members in its employ for the ensuing year. The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia in its estimates of the funds necessary for the operation of its respective units, which estimates are submitted to the Governor and General Assembly, shall include a request for an appropriation payable to the board of trustees in an amount equal to the portion of the normal and accrued liability contributions payable from funds of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia or from other state funds and for an additional amount as expense for the operation of the retirement system. The General Assembly shall make appropriations to the board of trustees sufficient to provide for such contributions as a part of the earnable compensation of members payable from such funds and for the necessary expenses of carrying out this chapter.

It shall be the duty of the employers operating local retirement funds to report to the board of trustees annually or at such other intervals as shall be set by the board of trustees the earnable compensation paid from state funds of each teacher in their employ who is paid from state funds and such other information as may be needed for establishing the prospective benefit of the member.

            <p>§ 47-3-84. Credit for service rendered by members who have breaks in membership; payments required to obtain such credit
Any provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any teacher shall be entitled to have all teaching service included in computing creditable service, notwithstanding breaks in membership of more than four years, provided that such teacher pays into the retirement system an amount equal to the minimum required for continuous members, plus regular interest that would have accrued on such contributions during periods of nonmembership. No member shall receive credit for teaching service if contributions were not made during the teaching service or have not later been contributed with interest that would have accrued on such contributions, provided that after three years' membership service a member may reestablish previous credits by paying into the retirement system, prior to retirement, contributions equal to 10 percent of such compensation as he received during those years and for which he desires to establish previous credit, plus regular interest that would have accrued on such contributions.

              <p>of this Code section, any current member who was previously a member of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia and who withdrew employee contributions from that system may reestablish the creditable service represented by the withdrawn contributions by paying to the board of trustees the minimum employee contributions required for continuous members of this retirement system, plus regular interest that would have accrued on such amount from the date that contributions to the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia stopped being credited with interest. Upon receipt of notice from the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia that a member has repaid to it contributions previously withdrawn from the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia, the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia shall pay an employer contribution plus regular interest to the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia. The amount of such employer contributions shall be 6 percent of the reported compensation of the member while a member of said employees' retirement system. The employees' retirement system shall pay an additional amount of retirement contributions pursuant to Code Section 47-2-51 for an employees' retirement system member covered by Code Section 47-2-334. This payment shall be placed in the pension accumulation fund and will adjust the amount of employee retirement contributions required for service credit.</p>

              <p>Any member who is in service or on authorized leave may retire on disability upon written application to the board of trustees if the member has at least ten years of creditable service at the time of retirement and if the member's application for disability retirement is approved by the medical board. The medical board shall approve the application if, after a medical examination of such member by a qualified physician appointed by the board of trustees, it finds that the applicant is mentally or physically incapacitated for further performance of duty involving active membership with the retirement system, that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the applicant should be retired. The effective date of retirement will be the first of the month in which the application is received by the board of trustees, provided that no retirement application will be effective earlier than the first of the month following the final month of the applicant's employment. Applications for retirement will not be accepted more than 90 days in advance of the effective date of retirement.

(a.1)  If the board of trustees determines by clear and convincing evidence presented to the board by or on behalf of the member that the disability itself was the cause of failure to file a timely application for disability retirement, the board of trustees is authorized to calculate the annual benefit provided for in subsection</p>

Such beneficiary may himself request such an examination.

The board of trustees may make further changes in his disability benefit in response to further change in his earning capacity, provided that the new pension shall not cause the total of his disability retirement benefit together with the amount earnable by him to exceed the current rate of compensation, as determined by the board of trustees, for the position which he held at the time of his disability retirement.

            <p>§ 47-3-125. Application of increases in retirement benefits to persons who retired pursuant to county, municipal, or local board of education retirement or pension systems
On and after July 1, 1980, and to the extent that the necessary funds are appropriated therefor by the General Assembly, whenever the retirement benefits of beneficiaries under this chapter are increased pursuant to Code Section 47-3-126, the board of trustees shall make a corresponding increase in the retirement benefits of retired public school teachers who retired prior to July 1, 1978, pursuant to a county, municipal, or local board of education retirement or pension system. Such corresponding increase shall be equivalent to the percentage increase in retirement benefits of beneficiaries under this chapter. For the purposes of this Code section, such retired public school teachers shall be deemed to be members of the retirement system. The board of trustees shall pay directly to each such retired public school teacher the increased retirement benefits provided for in this Code section. Increases in retirement benefits granted on and after July 1, 1980, to such retired public school teachers by a county, municipal, or local board of education retirement or pension system shall not reduce or replace the increase in retirement benefits payable to such retired public school teachers under this Code section. If the General Assembly at any time appropriates some but not all of the funds necessary to fund the increase in retirement benefits under this Code section, then the increased retirement benefit otherwise payable under this Code section shall be reduced pro rata by the board of trustees in accordance with the funds actually appropriated by the General Assembly for such purpose.

            <p>§ 47-3-126. Postretirement benefit adjustmentsThe board of trustees is authorized to adopt a method of providing postretirement benefit adjustments for a beneficiary in his postretirement years. Such method of adjustment may result in the adoption by the board of trustees of a method of financing other than that described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of Code Section 47-3-43 and shall be based upon:
(1)  Recommendation of the actuaries for the board of trustees; and

(2)  Maintaining the actuarial soundness of the system.

The board of trustees may specify a minimum age which a beneficiary must have attained in order to be eligible for the postretirement benefit adjustment.

No person who commits or conspires to commit the murder or voluntary manslaughter of a member or retiree shall receive any refund of contributions or retirement benefits under this chapter upon the death of the member or retiree, even though the person so killing or conspiring is the named beneficiary for such refund of contributions or retirement benefits. A plea of guilty or a judicial finding of guilt, not reversed or otherwise set aside as to any of such crimes, shall be prima-facie evidence of guilt in determining rights under this chapter. All right, interest, and entitlement to any such refund of contributions or retirement benefits shall go to the secondary beneficiary designated by the member or retiree, if the secondary beneficiary is living, upon the death of the member or retiree, otherwise to the member's or retiree's estate.

In developing rules and regulations to determine how much service in any year is equivalent to one year of membership service, the board shall be guided by the nature of the employment being considered and the number of months, weeks, days, and hours normally worked to carry out the normal duties associated with the employment. Service rendered for a regular school year shall be equivalent to one year of service in any case.</p>

              <p>It is declared to be the intent of the General Assembly to provide a method whereby the municipal corporations and certain other entities of this state may, in the discretion of their respective governing bodies, provide retirement and other benefits to their employees through a common administrative and investment system. Such a system based on joint participation will permit municipal corporations and other entities, regardless of size, to provide certain benefits to their employees, will reduce overall administrative costs which might be prohibitive if undertaken individually, will make possible better investment opportunities, and through a provision for continuity of service will provide added security for professional employees who transfer from one municipal corporation or other entity to another in the state. Creation of such a retirement system is considered to be in the public interest in order to attract and retain better qualified personnel in local governmental service and to provide greater personal security to local governmental employees in their old age.</p>

            <p>§ 47-5-20. Creation of board of trustees
There is created a public corporation of this state to be known as "The Board of Trustees of the Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System (GMEBS)." Said corporation shall be the successor to the Joint Municipal Employees Retirement System (JMERS) and it is the intent of this chapter that all rights, duties, and obligations of JMERS are assigned to and are assumed by the new system.

(3)  No prior service credit for military service may be obtained under this Code section if credit for such military service has been or may be obtained under any other provision of this chapter;

(4)  No prior service credit for military service may be obtained under this Code section if such military service has been or may be used in the determination of the member's eligibility for retirement benefits or allowances under any other state retirement or pension system, any retirement or pension system of a political subdivision, or any federal retirement or pension program, except social security and those retirement programs covered under Public Law 810, 80th Congress, as amended;

(5)  The total amount of prior service credit for military service may not exceed five years for all military service which is creditable as prior service under this chapter; and

            <p>§ 47-7-2. Purpose of fund; legislative intentThe fund is established as a voluntary pension system which provides benefits intended to supplement primary pension benefits provided by fire departments or the governmental units or volunteer districts establishing fire departments. It is the intent of the General Assembly in authorizing the benefits of this chapter:
(1)  To provide an additional benefit which may be used by fire departments of the state or political subdivisions of the state to attract and retain qualified firefighters; and

(2)  To limit the availability of such benefits to those fire departments which satisfy the minimum requirements for membership provided in this chapter so as to induce political subdivisions and the fire departments serving such political subdivisions to meet and maintain compliance with such minimum standards which the General Assembly deems essential to improving the ability of a fire department to suppress fires.

(1)  Any person who served as a volunteer firefighter prior to March 3, 1955, and who began receiving retirement benefits at a later date from the fund, based on the board of trustees' belief that such person was eligible for such benefits, but whose retirement benefits were ceased or canceled by the board of trustees based upon its subsequent realization that such person was not in fact eligible for such benefits; or

(2)  Any person who left service as a volunteer firefighter after receiving written notice from the executive director of the fund that such person was eligible for retirement benefits except for not having reached the age of 60 years, which written notice was later determined by the board to be erroneous,

shall be eligible to receive the retirement benefits under this chapter in the same manner as if such service had been rendered in a class nine or better fire department, regardless of the fact that such service was not rendered in a class nine or better fire department.

(A)  The information is known outside the portfolio manager only to actual and potential investors who have signed a nondisclosure agreement prior to receiving any information, which nondisclosure agreement is required to be signed by participants in the investment, and breach of confidentiality by the investors would be grounds for terminating the investment contract between the investor and the portfolio manager;

(B)  The information collected by the portfolio manager requires specialized expertise and experience to research companies in which the firm invests, the market for those companies, and their competitors. The portfolio manager has its own proprietary means of selecting companies in which to invest and for packaging portfolios for the limited partners, and research processes, methodologies and qualitative analysis of the data are unique and specialized in each firm's organization. Additional value may be added to the information with analysis, assessment, and conclusions, which serve as the basis for the investor's decision to invest in a portfolio; and(C)  The portfolio manager guards the secrecy and confidentiality of the information in their proprietary databases during all phases of its work, including research, analysis, marketing, and dissemination and access to the information within the portfolio manager or partnership is limited to the researchers, analysts, and senior management of the general partner who put the information together for the limited partners and the limited partners and the persons in their financial operations who have signed the nondisclosure agreement.</p>
