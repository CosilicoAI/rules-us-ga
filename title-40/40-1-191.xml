          <p>The General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to provide uniform administration and parity among ride share network services, transportation referral services, and transportation referral service providers, including taxi services, that operate in this state for the safety and protection of the public. The General Assembly fully occupies and preempts the entire field of administration and regulation over ride share network services, transportation referral services, transportation referral service providers, and taxi services as governed by this part; provided, however, that the governing authority of any county or municipal airport shall be authorized to regulate any ride share network service, transportation referral service, transportation referral service provider, and taxi service consistent with the process used for limousine carriers, as set forth in Code Section 40-1-162, who are doing business at any such airport and may establish fees as part of such regulation process; provided, further, that such fees shall not exceed the airport's approximate cost of permitting and regulating ride share network services, transportation referral services, transportation referral service providers, and taxi services; and provided, further, that such governing authorities of such airports shall accept a for-hire license endorsement or private background check certification pursuant to Code Section 40-5-39 as adequate evidence of sufficient criminal background investigations and shall not require any fee for any further criminal background investigation; and provided, further, that local governments may maintain certificates of public necessity and convenience and medallion requirements and company requirements for taxi services as provided in this part and may establish maximum fares for taxi services. The list of ride share network services, transportation referral services, transportation referral service providers, and taxi services on the website of the department shall be sufficient evidence that such services have licenses issued by the department.</p>
