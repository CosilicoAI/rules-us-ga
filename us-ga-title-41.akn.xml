A nuisance is anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable man.

              <p>It is the declared policy of the state to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural and forest land and facilities for the production or distribution of food and other agricultural products, including without limitation forest products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural or agriculture-supporting industrial or commercial areas or forest land or when there are changed conditions in or around the locality of an agricultural facility or agricultural support facility, such operations often become the subject of nuisance actions. As a result, such facilities are sometimes forced to cease operations. Many others are discouraged from making investments in agricultural support facilities or farm improvements or adopting new related technology or methods. It is the purpose of this Code section to reduce losses of the state's agricultural and forest land resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural facilities and operations or agricultural support facilities may be deemed to be a nuisance.</p>

Whenever a nuisance is kept, maintained, or exists, as defined in Code Section 41-3-1 or 41-3-1.1, the district attorney, the solicitor-general, city attorney, or county attorney, or any private citizen of the county may maintain an action in the name of the state upon the relation of such attorney or private citizen to enjoin said nuisance perpetually, the person or persons conducting or maintaining the same, and the owner or agent of the building, structure, or place, and the ground itself in or upon which such nuisance exists. In an action to enjoin a nuisance, the court, upon application therefor alleging that the nuisance complained of exists, shall order a temporary restraining order or an interlocutory injunction as provided in Code Section 9-11-65.
