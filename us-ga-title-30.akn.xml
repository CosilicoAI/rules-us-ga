            <p>§ 30-10-1. Legislative findingsThe General Assembly finds and declares the following:
(1)  It is an essential function of state government to provide basic support for persons with one or more mental or physical impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities, whether the impairments are congenital or occur by reason of accident, injury, age, or disease;

(2)  The cost of providing basic support for persons with mental or physical impairments is difficult for many citizens to afford, and they are forced to rely upon the government to provide that support;

(3)  The families and friends of persons with mental or physical impairments desire to supplement, but not replace, the basic support provided by state government and other governmental programs;

(4)  Medical, social, and other supplemental services are often provided by family members and friends of persons with mental or physical impairments for the lifetime of the impaired persons; and

(5)  It is necessary and desirable for the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state to encourage, enhance, and foster the ability of family members and friends of those individuals with mental or physical impairments to supplement, but not to replace, the basic support provided by state government and other governmental programs and to provide for medical, social, or other supplemental services for those persons with impairments.

            <p>§ 30-3-1. Purpose and intent of chapter
The provisions of this chapter are enacted to further the policy of the State of Georgia to encourage and enable persons with disabilities or elderly persons to participate fully in the social and economic life of Georgia and to encourage and promote their education and rehabilitation. It is the intent of this chapter to eliminate, insofar as possible, unnecessary physical barriers encountered by persons with disabilities or elderly persons whose ability to participate in the social and economic life of this state is needlessly restricted when such persons cannot readily use government buildings, public buildings, and facilities used by the public.

All government buildings, public buildings, and facilities receiving permits for construction or renovation after July 1, 1995, shall comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner which meet ADAAG and establish the minimum state standards for accessibility. All government buildings, public buildings, and facilities receiving permits for construction or renovation after July 1, 1984, but before July 1, 1987, shall comply with the American National Standards Institute specifications A117.1-1980 or A117.1-1986 for making buildings and facilities accessible to and usable by people with disabilities except as otherwise provided in paragraph (10) of Code Section 30-3-2; and all government buildings, public buildings, and facilities receiving permits for construction or renovation after July 1, 1987, but before July 1, 1995, shall comply with the American National Standards Institute specifications A117.1-1986 for making buildings and facilities accessible to and usable by people with disabilities except as otherwise provided in paragraph (10) or subparagraph (C) of paragraph (11) of Code Section 30-3-2; provided, however, that nothing in this Code section is intended to require the addition of an elevator where none exists or is planned, solely for the purpose of providing an accessible route between floor levels; provided, further, that the Safety Fire Commissioner or, where applicable, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia or the local governing authority having jurisdiction over the buildings in question upon receipt of a sworn written statement from the person who owns or controls the use of any government building, public building, or facility subject to the requirements of this chapter and after taking all circumstances into consideration may determine that full compliance with any particular standard or specification set forth in this chapter is impractical, whereupon there shall be substantial compliance with the standards or specifications to the maximum extent practical and, within 45 days of such determination, a written record shall be made by the Safety Fire Commissioner or, where applicable, the board of regents or the local governing authority having jurisdiction over the buildings in question, setting forth the reasons why it is impractical for the person subject to this chapter to comply fully with the particular standard or specification and also setting forth the extent to which the government building, public building, or facility shall conform with the standard or specification.

(A)  No such building shall be built in this state by any private person or corporation or public entity unless it conforms to the requirements of Code Sections 30-3-3 and 30-3-5 and its plans and specifications have been approved by the Commissioner as provided in this subparagraph. All plans and specifications shall identify the architect or engineer who prepared them in a manner acceptable to the Commissioner. The Commissioner shall approve the plans and specifications only if they conform to the requirements of this chapter. The Commissioner shall not require any additional fee for each submission of plans or specifications other than the standard fee required by Code Section 25-2-4.1. No local governing authority shall issue any building permit for any building subject to this subsection without proof of the approval required by this subparagraph;

(B)  In any case where the Commissioner denies approval under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or an exemption under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the rights and remedies of the person submitting the same shall be those provided by Chapter 2 of Title 33;

(C)  Upon a showing that full compliance with any particular requirement or requirements is impractical or not necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, the Commissioner may exempt a building from full compliance with the requirement or requirements and approve plans and specifications which do not conform, or which only partially conform, to the requirement or requirements.</p>

If a report of a disabled adult or elder person abuse, neglect, or exploitation is made to an adult protection agency or independently discovered by the agency, then the agency shall immediately make a reasonable determination based on available information as to whether the incident alleges actions by an individual, other than the disabled adult or elder person, that constitute a crime and include such information in their report. If a crime is suspected, the report shall immediately be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency or prosecuting attorney. During an adult protection agency's investigation, it shall be under a continuing obligation to immediately report the discovery of any evidence that may constitute a crime.(B)  If the disabled adult or person is 65 years of age or older and is a resident, a report shall be made in accordance with Article 4 of Chapter 8 of Title 31. If a report made in accordance with the provisions of this Code section alleges that the abuse or exploitation occurred within a long-term care facility, such report shall be investigated in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of Chapter 8 of Title 31.</p>
