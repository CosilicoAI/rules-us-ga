          <p>It is declared that there exist in the state unsanitary and unsafe dwelling accommodations; that persons of low income are forced to reside in such accommodations; that within the state there is a shortage of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are therefore forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the state and impair economic values; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection and other public services and facilities; that these distressed areas cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved, solely through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income, as such persons are defined in Code Section 8-3-3, would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise; that the clearance, replanning, and reconstruction of the areas in which unsanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired; and that it is in the public interest that work on such projects be commenced as soon as possible in order to relieve unemployment which now constitutes an emergency. The necessity in the public interest for the provisions enacted in this article is declared as a matter of legislative determination.</p>
