          <p>If the governing body of each of two or more contiguous counties by resolution declares that there is a need for one housing authority to be created for all of such counties to exercise in such counties powers and other functions prescribed for a regional housing authority, a public body corporate and politic to be known as a regional housing authority shall thereupon exist for all of such counties and shall exercise its powers and other functions in such counties. Thereupon, each county housing authority created for each of such counties shall cease to exist except for the purpose of winding up its affairs and executing a deed to the regional housing authority as provided in this part. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section to the contrary, the governing body of a county shall not adopt a resolution as aforesaid if there is a county housing authority created for such county which has any bonds or notes outstanding unless, first, all holders of such bonds and notes consent in writing to the substitution of such regional housing authority in lieu of such county housing authority on all such bonds and notes, and, second, the commissioners of such county housing authority adopt a resolution consenting to the transfer of all rights, contracts, obligations, and property, real and personal, of such county housing authority to such regional housing authority as provided in this part. When the above two conditions are complied with and such regional housing authority is created and authorized to exercise its powers and other functions, all rights, contracts, agreements, obligations, and property, real and personal, of such county housing authority shall be in the name of and vest in such regional housing authority; and all obligations of such county housing authority shall be the obligations of such regional housing authority; and all rights and remedies of any person against such county housing authority may be asserted, enforced, and prosecuted against such regional housing authority to the same extent as they might have been asserted, enforced, and prosecuted against such county housing authority.</p>
