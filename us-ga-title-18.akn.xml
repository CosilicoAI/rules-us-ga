          <content>
            <p>§ 18-2-76. When transfer madeFor the purposes of this article:(1)  A transfer is made:
(A)  With respect to an asset that is real property other than a fixture, but including the interest of a seller or purchaser under a contract for the sale of the asset, when the transfer is so far perfected that a good faith purchaser of the asset from the debtor against whom applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest in the asset that is superior to the interest of the transferee; and

(B)  With respect to an asset that is not real property or that is a fixture, when the transfer is so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire a judicial lien otherwise than under this article that is superior to the interest of the transferee;

(2)  If applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected as provided in paragraph (1) of this Code section and the transfer is not so perfected before the commencement of an action for relief under this article, the transfer is deemed made immediately before the commencement of the action;

(3)  If applicable law does not permit the transfer to be perfected as provided in paragraph (1) of this Code section, the transfer is made when it becomes effective between the debtor and the transferee;

(4)  A transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the asset transferred; and(5)  An obligation is incurred:
(A)  If oral, when it becomes effective between the parties; or

(B)  If evidenced by a record, when the record signed by the obligor is delivered to or for the benefit of the obligee.

            <p>§ 18-3-13. Procedure for contesting sufficiency of bond; requirement of additional security or new bond; failure to comply
When any attachment shall be issued and levied upon the property of the defendant, the defendant, his agent, or his attorney may file an affidavit stating that he has a good defense to the action, that the bond given in the action is not a good bond, and stating the ground of its insufficiency. When the affidavit is made and delivered to the levying officer, the officer shall return such attachment together with the affidavit forthwith to the judge issuing the attachment. The judge issuing the attachment shall without delay hear testimony as to the sufficiency of the bond and may in his discretion require additional security or a new bond to be given within such time as he may prescribe. If the plaintiff fails to provide such additional security or new bond, the judge shall dismiss the levy made under the attachment.

It shall be the duty of the levying officer taking the affidavit and bond to return the same to the court to which the attachment is returnable, unless the property levied on should be real estate, in which case it shall be his duty to return the same to the superior court of the county where the land lies, provided that, if the claimant is unable to give such bond and security, he may interpose his claim as provided in Code Section 9-15-2.

The claimant, his agent, or his attorney at law may give bond, with good security, payable to the levying officer, in a sum equal to double the value of the property claimed, the value to be judged by the levying officer, conditioned to deliver the property at the time and place of sale, provided the same should be found subject to the attachment; and, upon the delivery of the bond to the levying officer, it shall be his duty to deliver such property to the claimant, his agent, or his attorney at law; and it shall be the duty of the levying officer to return the bond, together with the affidavit and claim bond, to the court to which the attachment is returnable; and, when the claim is interposed by the agent or attorney at law of the claimant, the agent or attorney at law shall have power to sign the name of the claimant to the bond, who shall be bound thereby in the same manner as though he had signed it himself.

When the defendant has given bond and security, or when he has appeared and made defense by himself or attorney at law without raising a valid defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, the judgment rendered against him in such case shall bind all his property and shall have the same force and effect as when there has been personal service, and execution shall issue accordingly, but it shall be first levied upon the property attached. In all other cases, the judgment on the attachment shall only bind the property attached and the judgment shall be entered only against such property.

The lien of an attachment is created by the levy and not the judgment in the attachment; and in case of a conflict between attachments, the first levied shall be first satisfied; but in a contest between attachments and ordinary judgments or suits, it is the judgment and not the levy which fixes the lien. However, the lien of an attachment shall have priority over the lien of an ordinary judgment that has been obtained upon a suit filed after the levy of the attachment.

As against the interests of third parties acting in good faith and without notice who may have acquired a transfer or lien binding any real estate, no attachment levied upon real estate shall be a lien on the same from the levy thereof unless said attachment is entered upon the attachment docket of the county in which the real estate is situated within five days from said levy. When the attachment is entered upon the docket after the five days, the lien shall date from such entry; and it shall be the duty of the sheriff to have said entry made within the five days. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to affect the validity or force of any attachment as between the parties thereto.

              <p>A garnishment proceeding is an action between the plaintiff and garnishee; provided, however, that at any time before a judgment is entered or before money or other property subject to garnishment is distributed, the defendant may become a party to the garnishment by filing a claim with the clerk of court and may use the form set forth in Code Section 18-4-82. A defendant's claim shall assert the basis upon which he or she claims that his or her money or other property is exempt from garnishment. Money or other property may be exempt from garnishment for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the limitations on garnishment as provided in Code Sections 18-4-5 and 18-4-53, exemptions as provided in Code Section 18-4-6, the plaintiff not having a judgment against the defendant, the amount claimed due by the plaintiff being erroneous, such money or other property being subject to a claim held by a third party that is superior to the judgment described in the affidavit of garnishment, or other legal or statutory defenses. Even when earnings are held at a financial institution, such money may be exempt from garnishment due to the limitations on garnishment as provided in Code Sections 18-4-5 and 18-4-53, exemptions as provided in Code Section 18-4-6, or other reasons.</p>

At any time before judgment is entered on the garnishee's answer or money or other property subject to garnishment is distributed, any person may file a third-party claim in writing under oath stating that he or she has a claim superior to that of the plaintiff to the money or other property in the hands of the garnishee subject to the process of garnishment, and the third-party claimant shall be a party to all further proceedings upon the garnishment. A third-party claimant shall serve his or her claim upon the plaintiff, defendant, and garnishee. The form for a third-party claim is set forth in Code Section 18-4-88.

            <p>§ 18-4-18. Priority of conflicting claims to money or property
When money or other property in court is subject to a third-party claim or to more than one garnishment case, the party with the oldest entered judgment shall have priority to such money or other property and any interested party to any one of the garnishment cases may make a motion to the court where such money or other property has been deposited for the distribution of such money or other property. Each party of interest in each case and the clerk of court shall be served with a copy of the motion. Upon hearing the motion, the court shall enter an order directing that the clerk be paid the court cost of each garnishment proceeding first, and all remaining money or other property shall be distributed in accordance with the laws governing the relative priority of claims, judgments, and liens.

If the case is still in default after the expiration of the period of 15 days, judgment by default may be entered at any time thereafter against such garnishee for the amount remaining due on the judgment obtained against the defendant as shown in the plaintiff's affidavit of garnishment.

              <p>When a default judgment is rendered against a garnishee under Code Section 18-4-21, 18-4-22, or 18-4-43, the plaintiff shall serve the garnishee, as provided in Code Section 9-11-4, or, when the garnishment is filed in a magistrate court, the plaintiff may serve the garnishee by using the constable of the magistrate court in the manner set forth in Code Section 9-11-4, with a copy of such default judgment. On a motion filed not later than 90 days from the date the garnishee was served with such default judgment, the garnishee may, upon payment of all accrued costs of court, have such default judgment modified so that the amount of such default judgment shall be reduced to an amount equal to the greater of $50.00 or $50.00 plus 100 percent of the amount by which the garnishee was indebted to the defendant from the time of service of the summons of garnishment through and including the last day on which a timely garnishee answer could have been made for all money or other property belonging to the defendant which came into the garnishee's hands from the time of service of the summons through and including the last day on which a timely answer could have been made and less any exemption allowed the defendant.</p>

NOTICE TO DEFENDANT OF RIGHT AGAINST GARNISHMENT OF MONEY, INCLUDING WAGES, AND OTHER PROPERTY 

You received this notice because money, including wages, and other property belonging to you have been garnished to pay a court judgment against you. HOWEVER, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR MONEY, INCLUDING WAGES, OR OTHER PROPERTY.

 READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.

State and federal law protects some money, including wages, from garnishment even if it is in a bank. Some common exemptions are benefits from social security, supplemental security income, unemployment, workers' compensation, the Veterans' Administration, state pension, retirement funds, and disability income. This list of exemptions does not include all possible exemptions. A more detailed list of exemptions is available at the Clerk of Court's office located at            (Name of Court),            (Address),            (City), Georgia       (ZIP Code), and on the website for the Attorney General (www.law.ga.gov).

Garnishment of your earnings from your employment is limited to the lesser of 25 percent of your disposable earnings for a week or the amount by which your disposable earnings for a week exceed $217.50. More than 25 percent of your disposable earnings may be taken from your earnings for the payment of child support or alimony or if a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows a higher amount.

1.  Complete the Defendant's Claim Form as set forth below; and

2.  File this completed claim form with the Clerk of Court's office located at            (Name of Court),            (Address),            (City), Georgia       (ZIP Code).FILE YOUR COMPLETED CLAIM FORM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. You may lose your right to claim an exemption if you do not file your claim form within 20 days after the Garnishee's Answer is filed or if you do not mail or deliver a copy of your completed claim form to the Plaintiff and the Garnishee at the addresses listed on this notice.
The Court will schedule a hearing within ten days from when it receives your claim form. The Court will mail you the time and date of the hearing at the address that you provide on your claim form. You may go to the hearing with or without an attorney. You will need to give the Court documents or other proof that your money is exempt.

The Clerk of Court cannot give you legal advice. IF YOU NEED LEGAL ASSISTANCE, YOU SHOULD SEE AN ATTORNEY. If you cannot afford a private attorney, legal services may be available.
