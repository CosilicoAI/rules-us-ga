            <p>§ 2-10-60. Suspension or revocation of registration, license, or permit; procedure; enforcement of laws, regulations, or ordersAny other provision of this title or Article 1 of Chapter 13 of Title 50 to the contrary notwithstanding:
(1)  When the Commissioner, either through investigation or otherwise, has determined that any person has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in any act, practice, or transaction which is prohibited by any provision of this article or rule promulgated in support of this article governing activities for which registration with or a license or permit from the department is required, whether or not such person has so registered or obtained such a license or permit, the Commissioner may issue an administrative order, if he or she deems it to be in the public interest or necessary for the protection of the citizens of this state, prohibiting such person from continuing such act, practice, or transaction or suspending or revoking any such registration, license, or permit held by such person. The administrative order shall be final and effective ten days after issuance. The administrative order and notice of right to a hearing shall be served in person by the Commissioner or his or her agent or by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested. The person or persons to whom the administrative order is issued may within ten days of issuance petition the department for a hearing. A petition for hearing shall be deemed filed on the date the department receives such petition, or when mailed by first class mail, proper postage attached, properly addressed directly to the department, whichever date first occurs. The petitioner shall simultaneously serve a copy of such petition by certified mail, overnight mail, or personal service upon the Attorney General. If the person timely petitions the department for a hearing, the administrative order shall be stayed pending any administrative hearing until a final decision is rendered by the Commissioner. The administrative hearing shall be the forum in which the licensee may demonstrate that at the time of any alleged violation the licensee was in full compliance with the law;

(2)  If the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that an act, practice, or transaction is occurring or is about to occur, and that such act, practice, or transaction would constitute an imminent peril to the public safety or welfare requiring emergency action, the Commissioner may issue an emergency order to be effective immediately. The emergency order shall contain findings to such effect and reasons for the determination, along with notice of right to a hearing. The person or persons to whom the emergency order is issued may within five days of issuance petition the department for a hearing on the administrative order. If such person timely petitions the department for a hearing, the administrative order shall be stayed pending any administrative hearing until a final decision is rendered by the Commissioner;

(3)  Upon a timely request for hearing, the Commissioner shall schedule a hearing and appoint or designate a hearing officer to conduct the hearing for the taking of evidence and the issuance of a decision;

(4)  Except where in conflict with the express provisions of this Code section and the reasonable implication of such provisions, the provisions of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," relating to contested cases shall be applicable to the actions of the Commissioner taken pursuant to this Code section and to the conduct and judicial review of any hearings held as a result thereof;

(5)  The Commissioner may institute actions or other legal proceedings in any superior court of proper venue as may be required for the enforcement of any law or regulation governing activities for which registration with or a license or permit from the department is required;

(6)  The Commissioner may prosecute an action in any superior court of proper venue to enforce any order made by him or her pursuant to this Code section; and

(7)  In cases in which the Commissioner institutes an action or other legal proceeding or prosecutes an action to enforce his or her order, the superior court may, among other appropriate relief, issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary, interlocutory, or permanent injunction restraining or enjoining persons and those in active concert with them from engaging in any acts, practices, or transactions prohibited by orders of the Commissioner or any law or regulation governing activities for which registration with or a license or permit from the department is required. In any such action, it shall not be necessary for the Commissioner to allege or prove the absence of an adequate remedy at law.

          <content>
            <p>§ 2-11-21. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Advertisement" means all representations, other than those on the label, disseminated in any manner or by any means, relating to any seed within the scope of this article.

(2)  "Agricultural seed" means the seeds of grass, forage, cereal, oil, and fiber crops and any other kinds of seeds commonly recognized within this state as agricultural seed, lawn seed, and mixtures of such seeds and may include noxious weed seed when the Commissioner of Agriculture determines that such seed is being used as agricultural seed.

(3)  "Bulk" means a volume of seed in a container larger than a typical individual packaging unit for that kind, e.g., bulk bags and boxes, bins, trucks, rail cars, or barges.

(4)  "Coated or encrusted seed" means seed that has been covered by a layer or layers of materials that obscure the original shape and size of the seed resulting in a substantial weight increase. The addition of biologicals, pesticides, identifying colorants, dyes, polymers, and other ingredients can be included in this process.

(5)  "Dormant seed" means viable seed, excluding hard seed, that fail to germinate when provided the specified germination conditions for the kind of seed in question.

(6)  "Flower seed" means the seeds of herbaceous plants grown for their blooms, ornamental foliage, or other ornamental parts and commonly known and sold under the name of flower seeds in this state.

(7)  "Germination" means the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which, for the kind of seed in question, are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions.

(8)  "Hard seed" means seed that remain hard at the end of the prescribed test period because they have not absorbed water due to an impermeable seed coat.

(9)  "Hybrid" means the first generation of a cross produced by controlling the pollination and by combining: (A) two or more inbred lines; (B) one inbred or a single cross with another single cross or with an open-pollinated variety; or (C) two varieties or species, except open-pollinated varieties of corn (Zea mays) and other open-pollinated crop kinds. The second generation or subsequent generations from such crosses shall not be regarded as hybrids. Hybrid designations shall be treated as variety names and hybrids shall be labeled as hybrids.

(10)  "Inert matter" means all matter that is not seed, which includes but is not limited to broken seeds, sterile florets, chaff, fungus bodies, and stones as determined by methods defined by rule. The percent inert matter shall not exceed 3 percent for hybrid field corn, nor 4 percent inert matter for other agricultural crop seed, except as established by rule for special crops. Inert matter will not include coating or pelleting material, fertilizer, or mulch, for which there are no limitations.

(11)  "Inoculated seed" means seed that has received a coating of a preparation containing a microbial product, e.g., Rhizobium sp.

(12)  "Kind" means one or more related species or subspecies which singly or collectively are known by one common name, as, for example, corn, oats, alfalfa, and cotton.

(13)  "Labeling" means a tag or other written, printed, or graphic representations on any container or accompanying any lot of bulk seeds, including such representations as those on invoices, purporting to set forth the information required on the seed label by this article.

(14)  "Lawn and turf" pertains to seeds of the grass family (Poaceae) that are used within the industry for lawn and turf applications.

(15)  "Lot" means a definite quantity of seed identified by a lot number or other mark, every portion or bag of which is uniform within recognized tolerances for the factors which are required to appear in the labeling.

(16)  "Mixture," "mix," or "mixed" means seed consisting of more than one kind or variety or both, each in excess of 5 percent by weight of the whole.(17)  "Noxious weed seeds" include "prohibited noxious weed seeds" and "restricted noxious weed seeds," as defined in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, provided that the Commissioner of Agriculture may, through the promulgation of regulations, establish a list of seeds included under subparagraphs (A) and (B), whenever the Commissioner finds that such seeds conform to the respective definitions.
(A)  "Prohibited noxious weed seeds" are those weed seeds that are prohibited from being present in agricultural, vegetable, flower, tree, or shrub seed. They are the seed of weeds that are highly destructive and difficult to control by good cultural practices and the use of herbicides.

(B)  "Restricted noxious weed seeds" are those weed seeds that are very objectionable in fields, lawns, and gardens of this state but can be controlled by good cultural practice.

(18)  "Other crop seed" means seed of plants grown as crops (other than the kind or variety included in the pure seed) as</p>

The General Assembly declares that for the purpose of fostering improved agricultural methods, promoting advances in agricultural fields, and giving legal status to an existing practice and for the general welfare of the people it is necessary to establish as a policy of this state a method for protecting the public in the guarantee of the high quality of seeds and plants for various agricultural pursuits. It is the intent of the General Assembly to carry out that policy by this article, protecting the public from false claims and unwarranted statements as to genetic identity, varietal purity, and germinating viability of seeds and plants presented and claimed to be foundation, registered, or certified.

Agricultural liming materials may either be in solid or liquid (suspension) form. The following are types of agricultural liming materials:
(A)  "Burnt lime" is a material made from limestone which consists essentially of calcium oxide or a combination of calcium oxide with magnesium oxide.

(B)  "Calcitic liming materials" are those materials composed wholly or primarily of calcium carbonate.

(C)  "Dolomitic liming materials" are those materials composed of calcium and magnesium carbonates.

(1)  If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular;

(2)  If it is distributed under the name of another commercial feed;

(3)  If it is not labeled as required in Code Section 2-13-8;

(4)  If it purports to be or is represented as a commercial feed or if it purports to contain or is represented as containing a commercial feed ingredient, unless such commercial feed or feed ingredient conforms to the definition, if any, prescribed by regulation by the Commissioner; or

(5)  If any word, statement, or other information required by or under the authority of this chapter to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.

The Commissioner shall release the lot of commercial feed so withdrawn when such provisions and regulations have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within 30 days, the Commissioner may begin, or upon request of the distributor or licensee shall begin, proceedings for condemnation.</p>

            <p>§ 2-14-150. Legislative declarations; intent
The General Assembly recognizes that persons who patronize farms specializing in pick-your-own agricultural products may incur injuries as a result of the risks involved in such activity. The General Assembly also finds that the state and its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from such activity. The General Assembly finds, determines, and declares that this article is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly to encourage the direct sale of agricultural products from farmers to the general public by limiting the civil liability of farmers involved in such activity.

The Commissioner shall consider the reasonableness of any settlement or any apparent failure to litigate in good faith with the trustee.

          <heading>Inspection warrants</heading>
          <content>
            <p>§ 2-2-11. Inspection warrantsWhenever the Constitution or laws of the United States or the State of Georgia require the issuance of a warrant to make an inspection under any law administered by the Commissioner of Agriculture or the Department of Agriculture, the procedure set forth in paragraphs (1) through (7) of this Code section shall be employed.
(1)  The Commissioner or any person authorized to make inspections for the Commissioner shall make application for an inspection warrant to a person who is a judicial officer within the meaning of Code Section 17-5-21.

(2)  An inspection warrant shall be issued only upon cause and when supported by an affidavit particularly describing the place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected and the purpose for which the inspection is to be made. In addition, the affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Cause shall be deemed to exist if either reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle, or there is reason to believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle.

(3)  An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified therein, but not for a period of more than 14 days, unless extended or renewed by the judicial officer who signed and issued the original warrant, upon satisfying himself that such extension or renewal is in the public interest. Such inspection warrant must be executed and returned to the judicial officer by whom it was issued within the time specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the expiration of such time, the warrant, unless executed, is void.

(4)  An inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant shall be made between 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. of any day or at any time during operating or regular business hours. An inspection should not be performed in the absence of an owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle unless specifically authorized by the judicial officer upon a showing that such authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the regulation being enforced. An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible entry where facts are shown which are sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a violation of this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department, which, if such violation existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful. Where prior consent has been sought and refused and a warrant has been issued, the warrant may be executed without further notice to the owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle to be inspected.

(5)  It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to allow an inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant issued as provided in this Code section. Any person violating this paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

(6)  Under this Code section, an inspection warrant is an order, in writing, signed by a judicial officer, directed to the Commissioner or any person authorized to make inspections for the Commissioner, and commanding him or her to conduct any inspection required or authorized by this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department or regulations promulgated pursuant to this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department.

(7)  Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require an inspection warrant when a warrantless inspection is authorized by law or a permit issued under this title or any other law administered by the Commissioner or the department.

For purposes of complying with Code Section 2-21-3, certification does not require membership in nor imply a contractual agreement to produce or process organic food or feed for a certifying organic organization, business, firm, or individual.

(3)  "Commissioner" means the Commissioner of Agriculture of this state.

(4)  "Department" means the Georgia Department of Agriculture.

(5)  "Feed" means any article or substance normally intended to be consumed by animals for physical subsistence and health.

                <p>The condition.  That:
(A)  The farm, forest, and grazing lands of this state are among the basic assets of this state and the preservation of these lands is necessary to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of its people;

(B)  Improper land use practices have caused and have contributed to and are now causing and contributing to a progressively more serious erosion of the farm and grazing lands of this state by wind and water;

(C)  The breaking of natural grass, plant, and forest cover has interfered with the natural factors of soil stabilization, causing loosening of soil and exhaustion of humus and developing a soil condition that favors erosion;

(D)  The topsoil is being washed and blown out of fields and pastures;

(E)  There has been an accelerated washing of sloping fields;

(F)  These processes of erosion by wind and water speed up with removal of absorptive topsoil, causing exposure of less absorptive and less protective, but more erosive, subsoil; and

(G)  Failure by any landowner or occupier of land to conserve the soil and control erosion upon his lands causes a washing and blowing of soil and water from his lands onto other lands and makes the conservation of soil and control of erosion on such other lands difficult or impossible;</p>

                <p>The consequences.  That the consequences of such soil erosion in the form of soil washing and soil blowing are:
(A)  The silting and sedimentation of stream channels, reservoirs, dams, ditches, and harbors;

(B)  The loss of fertile soil material in dust storms;

(C)  The piling up of soil on lower slopes and its deposit over alluvial plains;

(D)  The reduction in productivity or outright ruin of rich bottom lands by overwash of poor subsoil material, sand, and gravel swept out of the hills;

(E)  The deterioration of the soil and its fertility, the deterioration of the crops grown thereon, and declining acre yields despite development of scientific processes for increasing such yields;

(F)  The loss of soil and water, which causes destruction of food and cover for wildlife;

(G)  A blowing and washing of soil into streams, which silts over spawning beds and destroys water plants, diminishing the food supply of fish;

(H)  A diminishing of the underground water reserve, which causes water shortages, intensifies periods of drought, and causes crop failures;

(I)  An increase in the speed and volume of rainfall runoff, causing severe and increasing floods which bring suffering, disease, and death;

(J)  The impoverishment of families attempting to farm eroding and eroded lands;

(K)  Damage to roads, highways, railways, farm buildings, and other property from floods and from dust storms; and

(L)  Losses in navigation, hydroelectric power, municipal water supply, irrigation developments, farming, and grazing; and</p>

                <p>The appropriate corrective methods.  That to conserve soil resources and control or prevent soil erosion, it is necessary that land use practices contributing to soil wastage and soil erosion be discouraged and discontinued and that appropriate soil-conserving land use practices be adopted and carried out and that among the procedures necessary for widespread adoption are:
(A)  The carrying on of engineering operations, such as the construction of terraces, terrace outlets, check dams, dikes, ponds, ditches, and the like;

(B)  The utilization of strip cropping, lister furrowing, contour cultivating, and contour furrowing;

(C)  Land irrigation;

(D)  The seeding and planting of waste, sloping, abandoned, or eroded lands with water-conserving and erosion-preventing plants, trees, and grasses;

(E)  Forestation and reforestation;

(F)  The rotation of crops;

(G)  Soil stabilization with trees, grasses, legumes, and other thick-growing, soil-holding crops;

(H)  The addition of soil amendments, manurial materials, and fertilizers for the correction of soil deficiencies or for the promotion of increased growth of soil-protecting crops;

(I)  The retardation of runoff by increasing the absorption of rainfall; and

(J)  The retirement from cultivation of steep, highly erosive areas and areas badly gullied or otherwise eroded.</p>

              <p>Where the supervisors of any district find that any of the provisions of land use regulations adopted in accordance with this article are not being observed on particular lands and that such nonobservance tends to increase erosion on such lands and is interfering with the prevention or control of erosion on other lands within the district, the supervisors may present a petition to the superior court of the county or counties within which the lands of the defendant lie. The petition shall set forth the adoption of the land use regulations, the failure of the defendant landowner or occupier of the land to observe such regulations and to perform particular work, operations, or avoidances as required thereby, and that such nonobservance tends to increase erosion on such lands and is interfering with the prevention or control of erosion on other lands within the district. It shall ask the court to require the defendant to perform the work, operations, or avoidances within a reasonable time and to order that if the defendant fails to do so, the supervisors may go on the land, perform the work or other operations or otherwise bring the condition of the land into conformity with the requirements of such regulations, and recover the costs and expenses thereof, with interest, from the owner or occupier of such land.</p>

The commission shall publish the result of the referendum. It shall consider and determine whether the continued operation of the district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable and feasible. If the commission determines that the continued operation of such district is administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and deny the petition; provided, however, that the commission shall not have the authority to determine that the continued operation of the district is administratively practicable and feasible unless at least a majority of the votes cast in the referendum were cast in favor of the continuance of such district. If the commission determines that the continued operation of such district is not administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and shall certify such determination to the supervisors of the district. In making its determination, the commission shall give due regard and weight to the attitudes of the owners and occupiers of lands lying within the district, the number of landowners eligible to vote in such referendum who voted, the proportion of the votes cast in such referendum in favor of the discontinuance of the district to the total number of votes cast, the approximate wealth and income of the landowners and occupiers of land of the district, the probable expense of carrying on erosion control operations within such district, and such other economic and social factors as may be relevant to such determination, having due regard to the legislative findings set forth in Code Section 2-6-21.

            <p>§ 2-7-19. Investigation on citizens' complaint; notice to owner; treatment or destruction of affected plants or other things or substances; costs
When two reputable citizens of any county in this state notify the Commissioner, from belief, that noxious insects or plant diseases exist in their county, the Commissioner shall ascertain as speedily as possible the nature and extent of the condition reported. If, after such investigation, it is determined by the Commissioner that it is necessary or desirable for the public interest, he shall act with all due diligence to control or eradicate such insects or plant diseases by giving notice to the owner, tenant, or agent of the owner of such premises to treat such affected plants or other things or substances according to the methods he may prescribe or to destroy them within the period set forth in such notice. If, after the expiration of the period set forth in the notice, the affected materials or other things or substances have not been destroyed or treated as prescribed in the notice or the treatment has not been properly applied or is not effectual in ridding the affected materials, things, or substances of the pests, the Commissioner shall cause such affected materials, things, or substances to be properly treated or destroyed, as his judgment warrants. The cost of the work shall be assessed against the owner of the premises and shall be collected in the same manner as that provided in Code Section 2-7-17.

            <p>§ 2-7-51. Purpose of article; legislative findings
The purpose of this article is to regulate, in the public interest, the labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, use, and disposal of pesticides. The General Assembly finds that pesticides are valuable to this state's agricultural production and to the protection of man and the environment from insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be pests but that it is essential to the public health and welfare that they be regulated to prevent adverse effects on human life and on the environment. New pesticides which are valuable to the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, and plant regulators are continually being discovered or synthesized. The dissemination of accurate scientific information as to the proper use of any pesticide is vital to the public health and welfare and to the environment, both immediately and in the future. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of such pesticides.

            <p>§ 2-7-70. Stop sale, use, or removal order
When the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a pesticide or device is being distributed, stored, transported, or used in violation of any of the provisions of this article or of any of the prescribed regulations under this article, he may issue and serve a written stop sale, use, or removal order upon the owner or custodian of any such pesticide or device. If the owner or custodian is not available for service of the order upon him, the Commissioner may attach the order to the pesticide or device and notify the owner or custodian and the registrant. The pesticide or device shall not be sold, used, or removed until this article has been complied with and until the pesticide or device has been released in writing under conditions specified by the Commissioner or until the violation has been otherwise disposed of as provided in this article by a court of competent jurisdiction.

          <content>
            <p>§ 2-7-91. Purpose of article; legislative findingsThe purpose of this article is to regulate, in the public interest, the use and application of pesticides to control pests, as defined in this article. Pesticides perform a valuable role by:
(1)  Controlling insects, fungi, nematodes, rodents, and other pests which ravage and destroy our supply of food and fiber, which serve as vectors of disease, and which otherwise constitute a nuisance in the environment or the home;

(2)  Controlling weeds which compete in the production of food and fiber and which otherwise are unwanted elements in our environment; and

(3)  Regulating plant growth to enhance both the quantity and quality of our supply of food and fiber and to facilitate its harvest.

New pesticides are continually being discovered, synthesized, or developed which are valuable for the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, and related purposes. However, such pesticides may be ineffective, may cause injury to man, or may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment if not properly used. Pesticides may injure man or animals, either by direct poisoning or by gradual accumulation of pesticide residues in the tissues. Crops or other plants may also be injured by the improper use of pesticides. The drifting or washing of pesticides into streams or lakes may cause appreciable damage to aquatic life. A pesticide applied for the purpose of killing pests in a crop which is not itself injured by the pesticide may drift and injure other crops or nontarget organisms with which it comes in contact. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of the use and application of such pesticides.

              <p>For the purpose of uniformity and in order to enter into cooperative agreements, the Commissioner may adopt "restrictive use pesticide" classifications as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition to those "restricted use pesticides" classified by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commissioner also may determine, by regulation, after a public hearing following due notice, "state restricted pesticide uses" for the state or for designated areas within the state. If the Commissioner determines that a pesticide use, when applied in accordance with its directions for use, warnings, cautions, and for uses for which it is registered, may cause, without additional regulatory restrictions, unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, including injury to the applicator or other persons because of acute dermal or inhalation toxicity of the pesticide, the pesticide use shall be applied only by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator or shall be subject to such other restrictions as the Commissioner may determine.</p>

The Commissioner shall be notified ten days prior to any reduction made at the request of the applicant or any cancellation of such surety bond or liability insurance by the surety or insurer. The total and aggregate liability of the surety and insurer for all claims shall be limited to the face of the bond or liability insurance policy or cash deposit. The Commissioner may accept a liability insurance policy, surety bond, or cash deposit in the proper sum, which has a deductible clause in an amount not exceeding $1,000.00 for aerial contractors and $500.00 for all other contractors, for the total amount of liability insurance, surety bond, or cash deposit required, provided that if the applicant has not satisfied the requirement of the deductible amount in any prior legal claim, such deductible clause shall not be accepted by the Commissioner, unless such applicant furnishes the Commissioner with a surety bond, liability insurance, or cash deposit which shall satisfy the amount of the deductible as to all claims that may arise in his application of pesticides. In the event that any contractor has an unpaid and outstanding judgment against him as a result of damages caused to a second party by the misuse of pesticides, he must provide a bond in an amount acceptable to the Commissioner before he can be licensed or relicensed.</p>

              <p>Any person claiming damages from a pesticide application shall file with the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, a written statement claiming that he has been damaged. This report shall be filed within 60 days after the date that damages occur. If a growing crop is alleged to have been damaged, the report must be filed prior to the time that 25 percent of the crop has been harvested. Such statement shall contain, but shall not be limited to, the name of the person allegedly responsible for the application of the pesticide, the name of the owner or lessee of the land on which the crop is grown and for which damage is alleged to have occurred, and the date on which the alleged damage occurred. The Commissioner shall prepare a form to be furnished for use in such cases. Such form shall also contain such other requirements as the Commissioner may deem proper. Upon receipt of such statement, the Commissioner shall notify the licensee and the owner or lessee of the land or other person who may be charged with responsibility for the damages claimed and shall furnish such copies of the statement as may be requested. The Commissioner shall inspect damages whenever possible. When he determines that a complaint has sufficient merit, he shall make such information available to the person claiming damages and to the person who is alleged to have caused the damage.</p>

2.  Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.

3.  A statement of the extent of the present and projected program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefor, in connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of introduction of the pest concerned.

4.  Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.

5.  A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the invoking of the compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of monies from the Insurance Fund in one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.

          <content>
            <p>§ 2-7-154. Powers of CommissionerThe Commissioner is authorized to:
(1)  Cooperate with and, as he may deem necessary, enter into written agreements with any other agency of this state, any agency of the federal government, any agency of another state, any person who may be engaged in the growing, processing, marketing, or handling of cotton, or any other person for the purpose of cost sharing or assignment of duties and responsibilities in destroying and eradicating the boll weevil in Georgia;

(2)  Inspect or cause to be inspected by duly authorized employees or agents any land, plants, plant products, or other articles, things, or substances that may, in his opinion, be capable of disseminating or carrying the boll weevil. For this purpose, the Commissioner or his employees and agents shall have the power to enter into or upon any place and to open any bundle, package, or other container containing or thought to contain any regulated article or other item capable of disseminating or carrying the boll weevil;

(3)  Require every person growing cotton in this state to furnish, on forms supplied by the Commissioner, such information as he may require relating to the size and location of all commercial and noncommercial cotton fields or patches being grown in this state;

(4)  Quarantine this state or any portion thereof or any other state or portion thereof when, after hearing, he determines that such action is necessary to prevent or reduce the spread of the boll weevil;(5)  Adopt, after hearing, such rules as he deems necessary to prevent or reduce the spread of the boll weevil, including but not limited to rules:
(A)  Governing the movement of regulated articles into, out of, or within this state;

(B)  Establishing eradication zones within the state where eradication efforts will be undertaken;

(C)  Restricting or prohibiting the planting of cotton in eradication zones when he determines that it would jeopardize the success of the eradication effort or present a hazard to the public health or safety;

(D)  Requiring that all growers of commercial cotton in the designated eradication zones participate in the eradication program, including cost sharing through assessment;

(E)  Establishing penalty fees for those growers in eradication zones who fail to comply with the rules adopted by the Commissioner; or

(F)  Imposing restrictions on pasturing of livestock, entry by humans, and location of honeybee colonies in any eradication zone which has been or is to be treated with pesticides for eradication of the boll weevil or in any other area affected by such treatments;

(6)  Enter upon any premise, property, or field within an eradication zone and treat with pesticides or destroy any volunteer or noncommercial cotton when he determines that such action is necessary to the success of the eradication efforts;

(7)  Require the destruction of commercial cotton in an eradication zone when it is not being grown in compliance with the rules adopted under this article; and(8)  Exempt from the assessment penalty requirements set forth in this article those cotton growers for whom paying the assessment penalties would impose an undue financial hardship.  The Commissioner is authorized to establish, upon the recommendation of the cotton growers' organization certified pursuant to Code Section 2-7-155, a payment plan in such hardship cases.  This exemption shall be implemented as follows:
(A)  The Commissioner shall adopt rules and regulations defining the criteria to be used in determining financial hardship; provided, however, that no exemption shall be granted to any cotton grower who, after the amount of assessments and penalties otherwise due has been subtracted from his taxable net income, as defined in Code Section 48-7-27, has a net income exceeding $15,000.00 for the year in which he seeks an exemption;

(B)  Any cotton grower who claims an exemption shall apply on a form prescribed by the Commissioner.  A separate application shall be filed for each calendar year in which a cotton grower claims an exemption.  Each application shall contain an explanation of the conditions to be met for approval.  An oath shall be included on the form and the form, upon completion, shall be returned to the Commissioner;

(C)  The Commissioner shall forward all completed exemption application forms to the cotton growers' organization certified pursuant to Code Section 2-7-155.  The certified growers' organization shall determine from the information contained in the application forms whether or not the applicants qualify for a hardship exemption and may recommend a payment plan to the Commissioner; and

(D)  The certified cotton growers' organization shall notify the Commissioner of its determination, which shall be binding upon the applicants. Upon receipt of the determination of the certified cotton growers' organization, the Commissioner shall promptly notify each affected cotton grower of that determination.  If an exempt</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 2-7-156. Assessment for suppression and eradication programs; conditionsAn assessment shall be levied upon all cotton growers in this state to cover, in whole or in part, the cost of boll weevil suppression and eradication programs authorized by this article, subject to the following:
(1)  All assessments imposed on cotton shall be levied on a per acre or per bale basis as determined by the Commissioner upon recommendation of the cotton growers' organization; provided, however, that the per acre assessment shall continue to be used so long as acreage certification is available to the department;

(2)  The per acre or per bale assessment, the period for which it shall be levied, and the geographical area to which the assessment applies shall be established by the Commissioner, upon recommendation by the board of directors of the cotton growers' organization;

(3)  When the assessment is imposed on a per bale basis, it shall be the duty of each first handler of cotton from cotton growers in this state to collect the assessments imposed pursuant to this article on such cotton, to file reports on forms prescribed by the Commissioner listing such sales and the name of the grower, and to remit the amounts so imposed and collected to the Commissioner within 30 days of the date of purchase of the cotton;

(4)  The Commissioner of Agriculture is authorized, and it shall be the Commissioner's duty, to receive, collect, hold in trust, and disburse all assessments and any other funds created under this article as trust funds of the cotton growers' organization, without complying with the requirements applicable to funds collected for the use and benefit of the state. Such funds shall not be required to be deposited in the state treasury and appropriated therefrom. All moneys collected by the Commissioner shall be deposited in a bank or other depository approved by the growers' organization and shall be disbursed by the Commissioner only upon the written authorization of the certified cotton growers' organization for the administration and implementation of the boll weevil eradication program. Should the eradication program be discontinued or certification of the growers' organization be revoked by the Commissioner, the assessments authorized by this article shall be discontinued on the date specified by the Commissioner and any funds remaining in its hands at such time are authorized to be paid out by the Commissioner for existing obligations and for winding up the affairs of the certified cotton growers' organization. Any funds remaining over and above those required for completing the business of the cotton growers' organization shall be paid by the Commissioner to the contributing growers on a pro rata basis;

(5)  Records maintained by the Commissioner on behalf of the certified cotton growers' organization shall be audited at least annually by the state auditor;

(6)  The Commissioner shall have a lien for the payment of assessments under this article which shall be of equal dignity with liens for taxes in favor of the state. The Commissioner is authorized to issue executions for the collection of such assessments in like manner as executions are issued for ad valorem property taxes due the state. It shall be the duty of each and every sheriff of this state and their lawful deputies, upon request of the Commissioner, to levy and collect such executions and to make their return thereof to the Commissioner in like manner as such tax executions are levied and return thereof made to county tax collectors and tax commissioners; provided, however, that the Commissioner shall be authorized to levy and collect his or her own executions;

(7)  In addition to the lien provided in paragraph (6) of this Code section, the Commissioner shall have a special lien on cotton for payment of assessments which shall be superior to any other lien provided by law, shall arise as of the time the assessments become due and payable, and shall cover all cotton grown by or ginned from the cotton grower from the date the lien arises until such assessments are paid; provided, however, that any buyers of cotton shall take free of such lien if such buyer has not received written notice of the lien from the Commissioner. Such lien extends to the proceeds of sale received by the person who originally bought the cotton from the grower. Notice may be provided by tagging the cotton as being subject to a delinquency or by documentation in the sales agreement indicating that the cotton is subject to a delinquency. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's authorized representative is authorized and empowered to so tag the cotton wherever found. In order to enforce such liens, the Commissioner is authorized to issue an execution for the collection of delinquent assessments due the Commissioner. The execution shall be directed to all and singular sheriffs of this state and shall command them to levy upon the cotton of the cotton grower or notified initial</p>

(B)  Authority for the establishment of uniform grading and inspection of peanuts and the establishment of grading standards of quality, condition, size, or pack of such peanuts;

(C)  Authority for the establishment of plans for advertising and sales promotion of peanuts;

(D)  Authority to prohibit unfair trade practices;

(E)  Authority for carrying out research studies in the production, processing, or distribution of peanuts;

Whenever producers or handlers of peanuts regulated by a marketing order issued by the commission pursuant to this article are required to comply with minimum quality, condition, size, or maturity regulations, no person, except as otherwise provided in such order, shall process, distribute, or otherwise handle any of such peanuts from any source, whether produced within or outside this state, which peanuts do not meet such minimum requirements applicable to producers or handlers of such peanuts in this state, provided that such regulations shall not apply to any peanuts which have been produced outside of this state and are in transit on the effective date of the regulations.

Furthermore, the commission may proceed against such producer and the purchaser of such peanuts simultaneously if the purchaser is a handler required to collect such assessment, until satisfaction is obtained.</p>

(2)  Provisions for carrying on research studies in promoting the production, marketing, sale, use and utilization, and improvement of equines or any combination thereof and for the expenditure of moneys for such purposes. In any research carried on under this paragraph, the Commissioner and the commission shall cooperate in selecting the research project or projects to be carried on from time to time. Such projects shall be carried out by postsecondary educational institutions or private organizations selected by the commission;

          <heading>Bond -- Required</heading>
          <content>
            <p>§ 2-9-5. Bond -- Required
Before any license is issued the applicant shall make and deliver to the Commissioner a surety bond executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the Commissioner. Any and all bond applications shall be accompanied by a certificate of "good standing" issued by the Commissioner of Insurance. If any company issuing a bond shall be removed from doing business in this state, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Insurance to notify the Commissioner of Agriculture within 30 days. The bond shall be in such amount as the Commissioner may determine, not exceeding an amount equal to the maximum amount of products purchased from or sold for Georgia producers or estimated to be purchased or sold in any month by the applicant; provided, however, that the minimum amount of such bond shall be $10,000.00 and the maximum amount of such bond shall be $230,000.00; provided, further, that in the case of pecans, such bond shall not exceed $500,000.00. Such bond shall be upon a form prescribed or approved by the Commissioner and shall be conditioned to secure the faithful accounting for and payment to producers or their agents or representatives of the proceeds of all agricultural products handled or sold by such dealer. However, in lieu of a surety bond, the Commissioner may accept a cash bond, which shall in all respects be subject to the same claims and actions as would exist against a surety bond. Whenever the Commissioner shall determine that a previously approved bond has for any cause become insufficient, the Commissioner may require an additional bond or bonds to be given, conforming with the requirements of this Code section. Unless the additional bond or bonds are given within the time fixed by written demand therefor, or if the bond of a dealer is canceled, the license of such person shall be immediately revoked by operation of law without notice or hearing and such person shall be ineligible to reapply for such license for a period of four years after such revocation.

              <p>Before any license is issued, the applicant shall make and deliver to the Commissioner a surety bond in the amount of 20 percent of the average of the highest dollar volume of grain purchases from producers made in any single month for each of the three preceding calendar years or such shorter period of years as the applicant has done business as a grain dealer, provided that the minimum amount of such bond shall be $20,000.00 and the maximum amount of such bond shall be $300,000.00. If a licensed grain dealer operates his or her grain-dealing activities at more than one physical location, he or she shall furnish a surety bond for each location of grain-dealing activities, each bond to be computed as stated in this Code section and each bond to be subject to the minimum and maximum amounts stated in this Code section. The bonds shall be executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the Commissioner. Any and all bond applications shall be accompanied by a certificate of "good standing" issued by the Commissioner of Insurance. If any company issuing a bond shall be removed from doing business in this state, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Insurance to notify the Commissioner of Agriculture within 30 days. Such bonds shall be upon forms prescribed by the Commissioner and shall be conditioned to secure the faithful accounting for and payment to the producers or their agents or representatives of the proceeds of all grain handled or sold by such dealer. Whenever the Commissioner shall determine that a previously approved bond has for any cause become insufficient, the Commissioner may require an additional bond or bonds to be given, conforming with the requirements of this Code section. Unless the additional bond or bonds are given within the time fixed by written demand therefor, or if the bond of a dealer is canceled, the license of such person shall be immediately revoked by operation of law without notice o</p>
