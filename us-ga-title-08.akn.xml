The provisions of this article shall be mandatory and binding on the state fire marshal, the Safety Fire Commissioner, and other state officials responsible for state building code, fire code, life safety code, or other construction code enforcement. This article is not mandatory or binding on local enforcement authorities; provided, however, that any local building, fire, life safety, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, or other construction code enforcement authority may apply the applicable provisions of this article to any existing building whenever the local governing authority has adopted this article by reference and whenever such local code enforcement authority determines the need to utilize compliance alternatives to any provisions of the rules, regulations, codes, or standards he or she is empowered to interpret, apply, or enforce under authority of any state law or local ordinance. This article is a tool for use of code enforcement authorities to use as deemed appropriate in attempting to resolve problems encountered while enforcing codes and standards with regard to existing buildings and structures. Enforcement authorities should advise appropriate appeals boards of the provisions, purposes, and intent of this article.

          <content>
            <p>§ 8-2-205. Identification and correction of certain conditions or defectsWith reference to existing buildings, authorized enforcement authorities should give special attention to the conditions or defects described in this Code section in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 8-2-204, so as to assure any such conditions or defects are identified and corrected as deemed appropriate by the enforcement authority having jurisdiction based on applicable state and local codes and through the utilization of appropriate compliance alternatives: 
   (1)  Structural.  Any building or structure or portion thereof which is in imminent danger of collapse because of but not limited to the following factors:
(A)  Dilapidation, deterioration, or decay;

(B)  Faulty structural design or construction;

(C)  The removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; or

(D)  The deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of the foundation; 

   (2)  Number of exits.  Less than two approved independent, remote, and properly protected exit ways serving every story of a building, except where a single exit way is permitted by the applicable state or local fire or building code or life safety code; 

   (3)  Capacity of exits.  Any required door, aisle, passageway, stairway, or other required means of egress which is not of sufficient capacity to provide for the population of the portions of the building served and which is not so arranged as to provide safe and adequate means of egress to a place of safety; and 

   (4)  Mechanical systems.  Utilities and mechanical systems not in conformance with the codes in effect at the time of construction of a building which create a serious threat of fire or threaten the safety of the occupants of the building.

Code Sections 8-2-207 through 8-2-211 contain generally acceptable compliance alternatives illustrating principles which shall be applied to the rehabilitation of existing buildings by state enforcement authorities and which may be applied by authorized local enforcement authorities in Georgia. It is recognized for purposes of this article that all building systems interact with each other; therefore, any consideration of compliance alternatives should take into account all existing and proposed conditions to determine their acceptability. The compliance alternatives are not all-inclusive and do not preclude consideration and approval of other alternatives by any enforcement authority.

Whenever action is taken on any existing building to repair, make alterations, or change the use or occupancy of an existing structure and, when said action proposes the use of compliance alternatives, the authorized enforcement authority shall ensure that at least one copy of the accepted compliance alternatives approved, including applicable plans, test data, or other data submitted for evaluation, be maintained on file in the office of the local enforcement authority. If said structure also falls under the jurisdiction of a state level enforcement authority, at least one copy of same material shall be maintained on file with that authority.

Where an existing building or structure falls within the jurisdiction of both state level and local level enforcement authorities, the final review of any part of the project which is under the jurisdiction of both such enforcement authorities shall occur with the state authority; provided, however, the local fire and building authorities must agree in writing with any compliance alternatives before such can be approved by the state authority. It is the intent of this Code section that the state enforcement authority be very liberal in the consideration and approval of compliance alternatives which have the documented support of local enforcement authorities.

If the existing building does not comply with the standards provided in this article and the authorized enforcement authority finds that the addition adversely affects the performance of the total building, the authorized enforcement authority may require:
(1)  The new addition to be separated from the existing structure by at least a two-hour fire wall with openings therein properly protected; or

(2)  The installation of an approved automatic fire suppression system; or

(3)  Other remedies which may be deemed appropriate by the enforcement authority.

            <p>§ 8-2-215. Minor alterations or repairs; reduction or removal of features; alteration or repair without further compliance; installation of mechanical systems
Minor alterations or repairs to an existing building which do not adversely affect the performance or safety of the building may be made with the same or like materials. Existing buildings which, in part or as a whole, exceed the requirements of any applicable construction or fire safety code, may, in the course of compliance with this article, have reduced or removed, in part or total, features not required by such code for new construction; provided, however, that such features were not a condition of prior approval. Existing buildings and structures which, in part or as a whole, do not meet the requirements of the applicable code for new construction may be altered or repaired without further compliance to any such code by utilizing the provisions of this article, provided their present degree of compliance to any applicable construction or fire safety code is not reduced. Any new mechanical systems installed in an existing building shall conform to applicable codes for new construction to the fullest extent practical as approved by the authorized enforcement authorities.

              <p>When the proposed use is of equal or lesser hazard as determined by an authorized enforcement authority, further compliance with any code for new construction is not required unless otherwise provided in this article. Alterations or repairs to an existing building or structure which do not adversely affect the performance of the building may be made with like materials. Any proposed change to the existing building or change in type of contents of the existing building shall not increase the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures. If the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures is increased, then requirements of applicable construction or fire safety codes for exterior walls shall apply.

Any proposed change in the use or occupancy of an existing building or portion thereof which could increase the floor loading should be investigated by a Georgia registered professional engineer to determine the adequacy of the existing floor system to support the increased loads. If the existing floor system is found to be inadequate, it should be modified to support the increased loads or the proposed allowable floor loading shall be reduced by and posted by the appropriate enforcement authority.

            <p>§ 8-3-151. Legislative findings and declaration of necessity
It has been found and declared in Article 1 of this chapter, the "Housing Authorities Law," that there exist in the state unsafe and insanitary housing conditions and a shortage of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities; and that the public interest requires the remedying of these conditions. It is found and declared that the assistance provided in this article for the remedying of the conditions set forth in Article 1 of this chapter constitutes a public use and purpose and an essential governmental function for which public moneys may be spent, and that the provisions hereinafter enacted are necessary in the public interest.

            <p>§ 8-3-154. Contracts for payments to state public bodies for improvements, services, and facilities provided
In connection with any housing project located wholly or partly within the area in which it is authorized to act, any state public body may contract with a housing authority or the federal government with respect to the sum or sums, if any, which the housing authority or the federal government may agree to pay, during any year or period of years, to the state public body for the improvements, services, and facilities to be provided by the state public body for the benefit of said housing project or its residents; but in no event shall the amount of such payments exceed the estimated cost to the state public body of the improvements, services, or facilities to be so supplied; provided, however, that the absence of a contract for such payments shall in no way relieve state public bodies of the duty to furnish, for the benefit of said housing project and its residents, customary improvements and such services and facilities as state public bodies usually furnish without a service fee.

            <p>§ 8-3-210. Procedure where local fair housing law applicable
Wherever a local fair housing law provides rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices which are substantially equivalent, as certified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as provided in Section 810 of the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, to the rights and remedies provided under this article, the administrator shall notify the appropriate local agency of any complaint filed which appears to constitute a violation of the local fair housing law, and the administrator shall take no further action with respect to such complaint if the local law enforcement official has, within 30 days from the date the alleged offense was brought to his attention, commenced proceedings in the matter.  In no event shall the administrator take further action unless the administrator certifies that, in the administrator's judgment under the circumstances of the particular case, the protection of the rights of the parties or the interests of justice require such action.

              <p>The administrator shall, within 100 days after the filing of the complaint, determine based on the facts whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, unless it is impracticable to do so or unless the administrator has approved a conciliation agreement with respect to the complaint.  If the administrator is unable to make the determination within 100 days after the filing of the complaint, the administrator shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.</p>

After the administrator issues a charge under this Code section, the administrator shall cause a copy thereof to be served on each respondent named in such charge, together with a notice of opportunity for a hearing at a time and place specified in the notice, and on each aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed.

Members of the commission shall serve without compensation but shall receive the same expense allowance per day as that received by a member of the General Assembly for each day such member is in physical attendance at a commission meeting, plus either reimbursement for actual transportation costs while traveling by public carrier or the same mileage allowance for use of a personal car in connection with such attendance as members of the General Assembly receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member shall receive said expense allowance or travel reimbursement if said member is entitled to receive an expense allowance or travel reimbursement or salary for performance of duties on some other state board, commission, or entity, by whatever name called, for work performed on that day in the same location. Expense allowances and travel reimbursement shall be paid from moneys appropriated or otherwise available to the trust fund.

            <p>§ 8-4-2. Legislative findings and declaration of necessityIt is found and declared:
(1)  That there exist in many communities within this state blighted areas, as defined in Code Section 8-4-3, or areas in the process of becoming blighted;

(2)  That such areas impair economic values and tax revenues; that such areas cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the state; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities;

(3)  That the clearance, replanning, and preparation for rebuilding of these areas and the prevention of the reduction of blight and its causes are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern;

(4)  That there are also certain areas where the condition of the title, the diverse ownership of the land to be assembled, the street or lot layouts, or other conditions prevent a proper development of the land; that it is in the public interest that such areas, as well as blighted areas, be acquired by eminent domain and made available for sound and wholesome development in accordance with a redevelopment plan; and that the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the financing of the acquisition and preparation of land by a public agency for such redevelopment is likewise a public use and purpose;

(5)  That redevelopment activities will stimulate residential construction which is closely correlated with general economic activity; and that such undertakings authorized by this chapter will aid the production of better housing and more desirable neighborhood and community development at lower costs and will make possible a more stable and larger volume of residential construction, which will assist materially in achieving and maintaining full employment;

(6)  That there exists an emergency housing shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low income; and

(7)  That it is in the public interest that advance preparation for such projects and activities be made now; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions enacted by this chapter is declared as a matter of legislative determination.

          <content>
            <p>§ 8-5-5. Duties of the art councilIn order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, the council shall do all of the following:(1)  (A) Determine and implement procedures for the purchase or lease by written contract of existing works of art from an artist or the artist's authorized agent. Works of art to be purchased or leased shall be selected by the council from lists of works prepared and submitted by advisory committees empowered by the council. In making such purchases or in executing such leases, preference may be given to artists who are Georgia residents. No lease obligation shall be incurred under the provisions of this chapter without the prior approval of the Office of Planning and Budget.
(B)  Determine and implement procedures, one of which shall provide for competition among artists, for the selection and commissioning of artists by written contract to create works of art. Commissioned artists shall be selected by the council from lists of qualified and available artists prepared and submitted by advisory committees empowered by the council. In making such contracts, preference may be given to artists who are Georgia residents.

(C)  If competition among artists is the procedure for selection of an artist pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a panel of three judges shall be appointed to make such selection. The panel shall consist of the director of the Office of Planning and Budget or a person designated by such director, a member of the council or a person designated by the council, and one person selected by the other two who shall be a visual artist, an architect or designer, a person employed by an art museum, or a collector of visual art. At least one judge on each panel shall be a working visual artist;

(2)  Consult with each artist commissioned regarding the design and placement of a work of art;

(3)  Ensure that works of art acquired pursuant to this chapter are placed in a manner so that they are within public view;

(4)  Ensure that the program for acquisition of works of art pursuant to this chapter results in participation by many different artists and in acquisitions from among many of the different art forms referred to in paragraph (4) of Code Section 8-5-3. A person who is, or is related to, a member of the council or is employed by the council or a person related to or employed in the office of the director of the Office of Planning and Budget may not be selected or commissioned pursuant to this chapter;

(5)  Cooperate with other affected state agencies and consult with the artist to ensure that each work of art acquired pursuant to this chapter is properly maintained and is not artistically altered in any manner without the consent of the artist;

(6)  Promulgate rules and regulations, as necessary, in consultation with the council and any other person, group, or association in the State of Georgia related to architecture, design, or the arts so as to facilitate the implementation of the council's responsibilities under this chapter; and

(7)  Authorize payments to artists for works of art acquired pursuant to this chapter.
