The results of those blood tests and comparisons, including the statistical likelihood of the alleged parent's parentage, if available, shall be admitted in evidence when offered by a duly qualified, licensed practicing physician, duly qualified immunologist, duly qualified geneticist, or other duly qualified person.

The review provided for in this paragraph as to the ability of the defendant to furnish support and as to the adequacy of the present support payments to the child's or children's needs shall not be had in less than two-year intervals and shall authorize the court to increase as well as to decrease the amount of child support to be paid as a term and condition of the suspended sentence. The review as to ability to support and adequacy of support shall not be equivalent to a hearing held in cases of revocation of probated sentences for purposes of service of the suspended sentence; nor shall a modification, if any, be deemed a change in sentence; nor shall a modification, if any, be deemed to change the suspended sentence to a probated sentence.

              <p>The department, in accordance with rules established by the Board of Human Services, shall be authorized to waive, reduce, or negotiate the payment of unreimbursed public assistance if it is determined that good cause for nonpayment exists or that enforcement of the claim would result in substantial and unreasonable hardship to the parent or parents responsible for the support of the child against whom the claim exists. The rules established by the Board of Human Services shall consider the ability of the responsible party to support the child or children during the period that public assistance was provided and the current history of regularity of payment by the responsible party. This subsection shall not apply to any court order or decree requiring the repayment of public assistance; however, the department is authorized to petition the court for consideration of a modification of an order or decree based on factors contained in this subsection and in the rules established by the Board of Human Services relating to such unreimbursed public assistance.

The department may examine any books, papers, or memoranda bearing upon the determination of the ability to support and for this purpose may, by means of subpoenas issued by its commissioner or his duly authorized representative, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant documents. Subpoenas of witnesses shall be served in the same manner as if issued by a superior court. If any person fails to obey a subpoena issued and served under this Code section with respect to any matter germane to the department's investigation, on application of the department, through the commissioner of human services or his duly authorized representative, the superior court of the county in which the person was required to appear may issue an order requiring the person to comply with the subpoena and to testify and to produce the relevant documents.

            <p>§ 19-11-13. Determination of paternity; acknowledgment under oath; legal proceedings
Whenever the department receives an application for services under this article on behalf of a child born out of wedlock and the child's mother identifies in writing the putative father of the child, the department may make an investigation of the surrounding circumstances and may request that the putative father acknowledge paternity under oath. If the department is unable to secure such an acknowledgment, the department may initiate legal proceedings to establish the paternity of the child, unless the department determines, in accordance with standards prescribed pursuant to the federal Social Security Act, that it is against the best interests of the child to do so.

To assist in the collection of a debt, the child support enforcement agency may disclose the name of an obligor against whom a lien has arisen and other identifying information including the existence of the lien and the amount of the outstanding obligation. A notice of a lien shall be filed as follows:
(A)  With respect to real property, the child support enforcement agency shall file notice of a lien in the county where property is located or in the county where the obligor resides. The social security number of the obligor shall be noted on the notice of lien. The filing shall operate to perfect a lien when duly recorded and indexed in the grantor index or when registered, as the case may be, as to any interest in real property owned by the obligor that is located in the county where the lien is recorded or registered. A special index for liens created under this chapter shall be maintained in each registry of deeds. If the obligor subsequently acquires an interest in real property, the lien shall be perfected upon the recording or registering of the instrument by which such interest is obtained in the registry of deeds in the county where the notice of the lien was filed within six yea</p>

              <p>In all cases involving the assignment and collection of child support, or where medical assistance benefits are being provided, the department or court may determine, as a regular part of its investigation and inquiry, whether accident and sickness coverage for the child or children involved is reasonably available to a party to a court order at a reasonable cost in connection with the party's employment or union. For purposes of this article, the term "person or entity providing access to coverage" shall mean an employer or union which offers a group insurance plan, as defined in Section 607</p>

              <p>In all IV-D cases, the child support enforcement agency shall notify the medical insurance obligor in writing that the National Medical Support Notice has been sent to the medical insurance obligor's employer or union, and the written notification shall include the medical insurance obligor's rights and duties under the National Medical Support Notice. The medical insurance obligor has the right to contest the withholding required by the National Medical Support Notice based on a mistake of fact. To contest, the medical insurance obligor must file a written notice of contest with the child support enforcement agency within 15 business days from the date of the National Medical Support Notice. Filing with the child support enforcement agency shall be deemed complete when the notice is received by the person designated by the child support enforcement agency in the written notification. Upon the timely filing of a notice of contest, the child support enforcement agency shall, within five business days, schedule an informal conference with the medical insurance obligor to discuss the medical insurance obligor's factual dispute. If the informal conference resolves the dispute to the medical insurance obligor's satisfaction, or if the medical insurance obligor fails to attend the informal conference, the notice of contest shall be deemed withdrawn. If the informal conference does not resolve the dispute, the medical insurance obligor has the right to request an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," within five business days after being notified of the results of the review by the child support enforcement agency. However, neither a request for informal review nor the filing of a notice of contest for an administrative hearing by the medical insurance obligor shall delay the withholding of premium payments by the union, employer, or health plan administrator.

            <p>§ 19-11-30.1. Bank Match Registry
The department shall establish a computer based registry of account data obtained from financial institutions doing business in this state. Such registry shall include only identifying information for obligors whom the child support enforcement agency believes owe child support and who are not under a child support order, and for obligors who are delinquent in an amount equal to or in excess of their support payment for one month. Such registry shall be known as the Department of Human Services Bank Match Registry. The child support enforcement agency shall be the sole agency with access to this data. Access shall be for the purpose of establishing and enforcing orders for support. The department is authorized to establish the procedures and the costs to be paid for performing the data searches and for providing the data to the department's child support enforcement agency.

            <p>§ 19-11-30.6. Reciprocal agreements with other states
The commissioner of human services, in cooperation with the child support enforcement agency, shall establish a program of wage and bank information sharing with other states. The commissioner is authorized to enter into reciprocal agreements with other states to share lists of absent parents who owe support payments to the child support enforcement agency. Such reciprocal agreements shall only be made with states which administer programs that the commissioner of human services, in consultation with the child support enforcement agency, determines are substantially similar. The wage and bank information sharing program shall apply only to states which have similar prohibitions and penalties for disclosure of information. The prohibitions and penalties of Code Section 19-11-30.4 shall also apply to any such information received from any other state under a reciprocal agreement.

A financial institution shall incur no obligation or liability to a depositor or account holder or any other person arising from the furnishing of a report or information to the department pursuant to Code Section 19-11-30.2 or from the failure to disclose to a depositor or account holder that the name of such person was included in a list furnished by the department or in a report furnished by the financial institution to the department.

If the mistake of fact is a mistake in the amount of support payments, however, the child support enforcement agency is not required to reimburse the account for any fees or costs levied against the account. Additionally, for the purposes of reimbursement to the account for any fees or costs, each certificate of deposit is considered a separate account.

          <content>
            <p>§ 19-11-43. Duty of support defined; criteria for determining existence of duty of support"Duty of support" includes any duty of support imposed or imposable by law or by any court order, decree, or judgment, whether interlocutory or final, and whether incidental to a proceeding for divorce, judicial (legal) separation, separate maintenance, or otherwise; for purposes of this article, in determining the existence of a duty of support, the following criteria may be considered, without limitation:
(1)  A person in one state is declared to be liable for the support of the person's spouse, in conformity with the support laws of this state, and for the support of any child or children of his under 18 years of age and residing or found in the same state or in another state having substantially similar or reciprocal laws; and, if the person is possessed of sufficient means or is able to earn such means, he may be required to pay for this support a fair and reasonable sum according to his means, as may be determined by the court having jurisdiction of the respondent in a proceeding instituted under this article. Notwithstanding the fact that either spouse has obtained in any state or county a final decree of divorce or separation from the other spouse or a decree dissolving their marriage, the obligor under this Code section shall be deemed legally liable for the support under this article of any dependent child of the marriage, whether or not there has been an award of alimony or support for the child or children;

(2)  The parents in one state are declared to be severally liable for the support of a child 18 years of age or older, residing or found in the same state or in another state having substantially similar or reciprocal laws, whenever the child is unable to maintain himself and is likely to become a public charge;

(3)  A child or children born of parents who, at any time prior or subsequent to the birth of the child, have entered into a civil or religious marriage ceremony shall be deemed the legitimate child or children of both parents, regardless of the validity of the marriage;

(4)  A child or children born to parents who held or hold themselves out as husband and wife by virtue of a common-law marriage recognized as valid by the laws of the initiating state and of the responding state shall be deemed the legitimate child or children of both parents;

(5)  A common-law marriage recognized as valid by the laws of the initiating state and of the responding state shall be deemed to be a valid marriage for purposes of this article;

(6)  Whenever a person has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction as the parent of a child born out of wedlock, the person shall be legally liable for the support of the child in the same manner in which the person would owe the duty of support if the child were a legitimate child.

Where the Attorney General is satisfied that reciprocal provisions will be made by any province or territory of the Dominion of Canada, the Attorney General may declare the province or territory to be a reciprocating state for the purpose of this article. Any such order declaring that a province or territory is a reciprocating state may be revoked by the Attorney General; and thereupon the province or territory with respect to which the order was made shall cease to be a reciprocating state for the purpose of this article; provided, however, that the revocation shall not affect any actions which have been adjudicated in the responding state or which have been received by this state as the responding state.

            <p>§ 19-11-66. Determination of paternity
If the obligor asserts as a defense that he is not the father of the child for whom support is sought and it appears to the court that the defense is not frivolous and if both of the parties are present at the hearing or if the proof required in the case indicates that the presence of either or both of the parties is not necessary, the court may adjudicate, by a jury trial if demanded by either party, the paternity issue. Otherwise the court may continue the hearing until the paternity issue has been adjudicated.

If he shows to the court that an appeal from the order is pending or will be taken or that a stay of execution has been granted, the court shall stay enforcement of the order until the appeal is concluded, the time for appeal is expired, or the order is vacated, upon satisfactory proof that the obligor has furnished security for payment of the support as required by the rendering state.

            <p>§ 19-13-17. Administrative fine
As an alternative to criminal or other civil enforcement, the commissioner or his or her designee, in order to enforce this article or any orders, rules, or regulations promulgated pursuant to this article, may issue an administrative fine not to exceed $1,000.00 for each violation, whenever that commissioner or his or her designee, after a hearing, determines that any person, firm, or corporation has violated any provision of this article or any order, rule, or regulation promulgated pursuant to this article. The hearing and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures for contested cases under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." Any person, firm, or corporation that has exhausted all administrative remedies available and that is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final order or action of the commissioner or his or her designee shall have the right of judicial review in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50. All fines collected or recovered by the commissioner under this Code section shall be remitted to the Office of the State Treasurer to the credit of the general fund of this state. The commissioner or his or her designee may file in the superior court (1) wherein the person under order resides; (2) if such person is a corporation, in the county wherein the corporation maintains its principal place of business; or (3) in the county wherein the violation occurred, a certified copy of a final order of the commissioner or his or her designee, whether unappealed from or affirmed upon appeal, whereupon the court shall render judgment in accordance with the judgment and notify the parties. The judgment shall have the same effect and proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same as though the judgment had been rendered in an action duly heard and determined by the court. The penalty prescribed in this Code section shall be concurrent, alternative, and cumulative with any and all other civil, criminal, or alternative rights, remedies, forfeitures, or penalties provided, allowed, or available to the commissioner or his or her designee with respect to any violation of this article or any order, rule, or regulation promulgated pursuant to this article.

              <p>The General Assembly finds and declares that violence in Georgia homes among family members accounts for many serious injuries, deaths, and extensive physical and emotional damage to children and adults.  Family violence knows no economic or social barriers. The costs of family violence include misery and trauma for individuals and families and increased government spending for police services, criminal prosecutions, incarcerations, court personnel, foster care, public assistance, and juvenile corrections.</p>

            <content>
              <p>The General Assembly has enacted comprehensive legislation addressing family violence, including provision for the issuance of temporary protective orders to protect individuals from violence.  It has become evident that enforcement of these laws is inconsistent and an effective response to family violence will require a comprehensive community effort as well as coordination among the courts, prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, the correctional system, and public assistance and other service providers.  The creation of a state commission and local task forces to combat family violence was highly recommended by the Georgia Commission on Gender Bias in the Judicial System.

            <p>§ 19-13-31. Commission created; comprehensive state plan for ending family violence; establishment of community task forces
There is created a State Commission on Family Violence which shall be responsible for developing a comprehensive state plan for ending family violence. This plan shall include the initiation, coordination, and oversight of the implementation of family violence laws and the establishment in each judicial circuit of a Community Task Force on Family Violence. These task forces shall be supported by and work in collaboration with the state commission. The commission shall be assigned for administrative purposes only, as set out in Code Section 50-4-3, to the Department of Community Supervision.

Marriage is encouraged by the law. Every effort to restrain or discourage marriage by contract, condition, limitation, or otherwise shall be invalid and void, provided that prohibitions against marriage to a particular person or persons or before a certain reasonable age or other prudential provisions looking only to the interest of the person to be benefited and not in general restraint of marriage will be allowed and held valid.

            <p>§ 19-3-10. Right of married persons to contract; presumptions
A married person may make contracts with other persons; but, when a transaction between a husband and wife is attacked for fraud by the creditors of either, the onus shall be on the husband and wife to show that the transaction was fair. If a husband or a wife has a separate estate and purchases property from persons other than his or her spouse, the onus shall be upon a creditor levying on such property as the property of the other spouse to show fraud or to show that the husband or wife did not have the means with which to purchase the property.

            <p>§ 19-3-36. Proof of age of applicants
The judge of the probate court to whom the application for a marriage license is made shall satisfy himself or herself that the provisions set forth in Code Section 19-3-2 regarding age limitations are met. If the judge does not know of his or her own knowledge the age of a party for whom a marriage license is sought, the judge shall require the applicant to furnish the court with documentary evidence of proof of age in the form of a birth certificate, driver's license, baptismal certificate, certificate of birth registration, selective service card, court record, passport, immigration papers, alien papers, citizenship papers, armed forces discharge papers, armed forces identification card, or hospital admission card containing the full name and date of birth. In the event an applicant does not possess any of the above but appears to the judge to be at least 25 years of age, the applicant, in lieu of furnishing the judge with one of the above, may give an affidavit to the judge stating the applicant's age. Applicants who have satisfactorily proved that they have reached the age of majority may be issued a marriage license immediately.

          <content>
            <p>§ 19-3-45. Actions for improper issuance of marriage license; attorney's fee and court costs; disposition of balance of recovery
Any judge of the probate court who by himself or his clerk knowingly grants a license without the required consent or without proper precaution in inquiring into the question of minority shall forfeit the sum of $500.00 for every such act, to be recovered at the action of the father or mother, if living, and, if not, at the action of the guardian or legal representative of either of such contracting parties, provided that under no circumstances shall more than one action be maintained by the father or mother, guardian, or legal representative of either of such contracting parties in connection with any one marriage; and provided, further, that no such action shall be brought prior to the expiration of 60 days from the date that the marriage becomes public and that no action under this Code section shall be maintained after the expiration of 12 months from the date the marriage becomes public. A recovery shall be had against the offending judge and his bondsmen. From the recovery a reasonable attorney's fee, to be fixed by the presiding judge trying the case, shall be paid to the attorney representing the person bringing the action and, after the payment of court costs, one-third of the remainder of the recovery shall be paid to the person bringing the action; and the remaining two-thirds shall be paid to the county educational fund of the county of the judge's residence. A judge who in good faith destroys physician's certificates of pregnancy and all records of the certificates under his control in accordance with the provisions of law shall not be prosecuted under this Code section for failure to require such a certificate from the applicants for a marriage license, if a birth certificate is issued for a child born to the applicants within the period of gestation after the marriage license was issued.

              <p>In any county in which there has been established an alternative dispute resolution program pursuant to Chapter 23 of Title 15, known as the "Georgia Court-annexed Alternative Dispute Resolution Act," the judge may, prior to trial, refer all contested petitions for divorce or permanent alimony to the appropriate alternative dispute resolution method. In counties in which an alternative dispute resolution program has not been established, a judge may nonetheless refer any disputed divorce case to an appropriate alternative dispute resolution method if a method is reasonably available without additional cost to the parties.

          <heading>Grounds for total divorce</heading>
          <content>
            <p>§ 19-5-3. Grounds for total divorceThe following grounds shall be sufficient to authorize the granting of a total divorce:
(1)  Intermarriage by persons within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity;

(2)  Mental incapacity at the time of the marriage;

(3)  Impotency at the time of the marriage;

(4)  Force, menace, duress, or fraud in obtaining the marriage;

(5)  Pregnancy of the wife by a man other than the husband, at the time of the marriage, unknown to the husband;

(6)  Adultery in either of the parties after marriage;

(7)  Willful and continued desertion by either of the parties for the term of one year;

(8)  The conviction of either party for an offense involving moral turpitude, under which he is sentenced to imprisonment in a penal institution for a term of two years or longer;

(9)  Habitual intoxication;

(10)  Cruel treatment, which shall consist of the willful infliction of pain, bodily or mental, upon the complaining party, such as reasonably justifies apprehension of danger to life, limb, or health;

(11)  Incurable mental illness. No divorce shall be granted upon this ground unless the mentally ill party has been adjudged mentally ill by a court of competent jurisdiction or has been certified to be mentally ill by two physicians who have personally examined the party; and he has been confined in an institution for the mentally ill or has been under continuous treatment for mental illness for a period of at least two years immediately preceding the commencement of the action; and the superintendent or other chief executive officer of the institution and one competent physician appointed by the court, after a thorough examination, make a certified statement under oath that it is their opinion that the party evidences such a want of reason, memory, and intelligence as to prevent the party from comprehending the nature, duties, and consequences of the marriage relationship and that, in the light of present day medical knowledge, recovery of the party's mental health cannot be expected at any time during his life. Notice of the action must be served upon the guardian of the person of the mentally ill person and upon the superintendent or other chief executive officer of the institution in which the person is confined. In the event that there is no guardian of the person, then notice of the action shall be served upon a guardian ad litem, who shall be appointed by the court in which the divorce action is filed, and upon the superintendent or chief executive officer of the institution in which the person is confined. The guardian and superintendent shall be entitled to appear and be heard upon the issues. The status of the parties as to the support and maintenance of the mentally ill person shall not be altered in any way by the granting of the divorce;

(12)  Habitual drug addiction, which shall consist of addiction to any controlled substance as defined in Article 2 of Chapter 13 of Title 16; or

(13)  The marriage is irretrievably broken. Under no circumstances shall the court grant a divorce on this ground until not less than 30 days from the date of service on the respondent.

            <p>§ 19-5-6. Grant of divorce to respondent without necessity of counterclaim
When a petition for divorce is filed, the respondent may recriminate in his answer and ask a divorce in his favor. If, at the trial, the court or jury believes that the respondent rather than the petitioner is entitled to a divorce, they may so find upon legal proof.

After a petition for divorce has been filed, no transfer of property by either party, except a bona fide transfer in payment of preexisting debts, shall pass title so as to avoid the vesting thereof according to the final verdict of the jury in the case; provided, however, that the title to real property shall not be affected by the filing of an action for divorce unless a notice of lis pendens, as provided for by Code Section 44-14-610, is filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the real property is situated and is recorded by the clerk in a book kept by him for that purpose.

            <p>§ 19-5-15. Effect of divorce
A total divorce annuls a marriage from the time of the rendition of the decree, unless the divorce is granted for a cause rendering the marriage void originally, in which case the divorce serves to annul the marriage from its inception. However, the issue of the marriage shall not be rendered born out of wedlock by a divorce, except in cases of pregnancy of the wife by a man other than the husband at the time of the marriage, unknown to the husband.

In cases of voluntary separation or in cases where one spouse, against the will of that spouse, is abandoned or driven off by the other spouse, a party voluntarily, by contract or other written agreement made with his spouse, may make an adequate provision for the support and maintenance of such spouse, consistent with the means of the party and the former circumstances of the spouse. Such an agreement shall be a bar to the right of the spouse to permanent alimony.

            <p>§ 19-6-10. Voluntary separation, abandonment, or driving off of spouse -- Petition for alimony or child support when no divorce pending -- Order and enforcement; equitable remedies; effect of filing for divorce
When spouses are living separately or in a bona fide state of separation and there is no action for divorce pending, either party, on the party's own behalf or on the behalf of the minor children in the party's custody, if any, may institute a proceeding by petition, setting forth fully the party's case. Upon three days' notice to the other party, the judge may hear the same and may grant such order as he might grant were it based on a pending petition for divorce, to be enforced in the same manner, together with any other remedy applicable in equity, such as appointing a receiver and the like. Should the petition proceed to a hearing before a jury, the jury may render a verdict which shall provide the factual basis for equitable relief as in Code Section 19-6-9. However, such proceeding shall be held in abeyance when a petition for divorce is filed bona fide by either party and the judge presiding has made his order on the motion for alimony. When so made, the order shall be a substitute for the aforesaid decree in equity as long as the petition is pending and is not finally disposed of on the merits.

Pending a final judgment in an action for divorce, the judge presiding may grant as temporary child support a sum sufficient for the support of the children of the parties in accordance with Code Section 19-6-15. The judge may also hear and determine who shall be entitled to the care and custody of the children until the final judgment in the case. If a sum is awarded for the support of the children, the party who is required to pay the support shall not be liable to third persons for necessaries furnished to the children.

In general, income and expenses from self-employment or operation of a business should be carefully reviewed by the court or the jury to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child support obligation. Generally, this amount will differ from a determination of business income for tax purposes. 

      (C)  Fringe benefits.  Fringe benefits for inclusion as income or "in kind" remuneration received by a parent in the course of employment, or operation of a trade or business, shall be counted as income if the benefits significantly reduce personal living expenses. Such fringe benefits might include, but are not limited to, use of a company car, housing, or room and board. Fringe benefits shall not include employee benefits that are typically added to the salary, wage, or other compensation that a parent may receive as a standard added benefit, including, but not limited to, employer paid portions of health insurance premiums or employer contributions to a retirement or pension plan. 

      (D)  Variable income.  Variable income such as commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, military bonuses, and dividends shall be averaged by the court or the jury over a reasonable period of time consistent with the circumstances of the case and added to a parent's fixed salary or wages to determine gross income.  When income is received on an irregular, nonrecurring, or one-time basis, the court or the jury may, but is not required to, average or prorate the income over a reasonable specified period of time or require the parent to pay as a one-time support a</p>

                <p>Reliable evidence of income. 
      (A)  Imputed income.  When establishing the amount of child support, if a parent fails to produce reliable evidence of income, such as tax returns for prior years, check stubs, or other information for determining current ability to pay child support or ability to pay child support in prior years, and the court or the jury has no other reliable evidence of the parent's income or income potential, gross income for the current year may be imputed. When imputing income, the court shall take into account the specific circumstances of the parent to the extent known, including such factors as the parent's assets, residence, employment and earnings history, job skills, educational attainment, literacy, age, health, criminal record and other employment barriers, and record of seeking work, as well as the local job market, the availability of employers willing to hire the parent, prevailing earnings level in the local community, and other relevant background factors in the case. If a parent is incarcerated, the court shall not assume an ability for earning capacity based upon pre-incarceration wages or other employment related income, but income may be imputed based upon the actual income and assets available to such incarcerated parent. 
      (B)   Modification.  When cases with established orders are reviewed for modification and a parent fails to produce reliable evidence of income, such as tax returns for prior years, check stubs, or other information for determining current ability to pay child support or ability to pay child support in prior years, and the court or jury has no other reliable evidence of such parent's income or income potential, the court or jury may impute income as set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, or may increase the child support of the parent failing or refusing to produce evidence of income by an increment of at least 10 percent per year of such parent's gross income for each year since the final</p>

              <p>of this Code section.       (D)   Willful or voluntary unemployment or underemployment.  In determining whether a parent is willfully or voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, the court or the jury shall ascertain the reasons for the parent's occupational choices and assess the reasonableness of these choices in light of the parent's responsibility to support his or her child and whether such choices benefit the child. A determination of willful or voluntary unemployment or underemployment shall not be limited to occupational choices motivated only by an intent to avoid or reduce the payment of child support but can be based on any intentional choice or act that affects a parent's income. A determination of willful or voluntary unemployment or underemployment shall not be made when an individual's incarceration prevents employment. In determining willful or voluntary unemployment or underemployment, the court may examine whether there is a substantial likelihood that the parent could, with reasonable effort, apply his or her education, skills, or training to produce income. Specific factors for the court to consider when determining willful or voluntary unemployment or underemployment include, but are not limited to:</p>

When considering the income potential of a parent whose work experience is limited due to the caretaker role of that parent, the court shall consider the following factors:
(I)  Whether the parent acted in the role of full-time caretaker immediately prior to separation by the married parties or prior to the divorce or annulment of the marriage or dissolution of another relationship in which the parent was a full-time caretaker;

(II)  The length of time the parent staying at home has remained out of the work force for this purpose;

(III)  The parent's education, training, and ability to work; and(IV)  Whether the parent is caring for a child who is four years of age or younger. If the court or the jury determines that a parent is willfully or voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support shall be calculated based on a determination of earning capacity, as evidenced by educational level or previous work experience. In the absence of any other reliable evidence, income may be imputed to the parent pursuant to a determination that gross income for the current year is based on a 40 hour workweek at minimum wage.

              <p>Payments being made by a parent on any arrearages shall not be considered payments on preexisting orders or subsequent orders and shall not be used as a basis for reducing gross income. 

      (C)   Theoretical child support orders.  In addition to the adjustments to monthly gross income for self-employment taxes provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and for preexisting orders provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, credits for either parent's other qualified child living in the parent's home for whom the parent owes a legal duty of support may be considered by the court for the purpose of reducing the parent's gross income. To consider a parent's other qualified children for determining the theoretical child support order, a parent shall present documentary evidence of the parent-child relationship to the court. Adjustments to income pursuant to this subparagraph may be considered in such circumstances in which the failure to consider a qualified child would cause substantial hardship to the parent; provided, however, that such consideration of an adjustment shall be based upon the best interest of the child for whom child support is being awarded. If the court, in its discretion, decides to apply the qualified child adjustment, the basic child support obligation of the parent for the number of other qualified children living with such parent shall be determined based upon that parent's monthly gross income. Except for self-employment taxes paid, no other amounts shall be subtracted from the parent's monthly gross income when calculating a theoretical child support order under this subparagraph. The basic child support obligation for such parent shall be multiplied by 75 percent and the resulting amount shall be subtracted from such parent's monthly gross income and entered on the Child Support Schedule B -- Adjusted Income.       (D)  Multiple family situations.  In multiple family situations, the priority of adjustments to a parent's monthly gro</p>

(A)  Work related child care costs necessary for the parent's employment, education, or vocational training that are determined by the court to be appropriate, and that are appropriate to the parents' financial abilities and to the lifestyle of the child if the parents and child were living together, shall be averaged for a monthly amount and entered on the child support worksheet in the column of the parent initially paying the expense. Work related child care costs of a nonparent custodian shall be considered when determining the amount of this expense.

(B)  If a child care subsidy is being provided pursuant to a means-tested public assistance program, only the amount of the child care expense actually paid by either parent or a nonparent custodian shall be included in the calculation.

(C)  If either parent is the provider of child care services to the child for whom support is being determined, the value of those services shall not be an adjustment to the basic child support obligation when calculating the support award.

(D)  If child care is provided without charge to the parent, the value of these services shall not be an adjustment to the basic child support obligation. If child care is or will be provided by a person who is paid for his or her services, proof of actual cost or payment shall be shown to the court before the court includes such payment in its consideration.

              <p>If either parent has health insurance reasonably available at reasonable cost that provides for the health care needs of the child, then an amount to cover the cost of the premium shall be added as an adjustment to the basic child support obligation. A health insurance premium paid by a nonparent custodian shall be included when determining the amount of health insurance expense. In determining the amount to be added to the order for the health insurance cost, only the amount of the health insurance cost attributable to the child who is the subject of the order shall be included.

(ii)  If coverage is applicable to other persons and the amount of the health insurance premium attributable to the child who is the subject of the current action for support is not verifiable, the total cost to the parent paying the premium shall be prorated by the number of persons covered so that only the cost attributable to the child who is the subject of the order under consideration is included. The amount of health insurance premium shall be determined by dividing the total amount of the insurance premium by the number of persons covered by the insurance policy and multiplying the resulting amount by the number of children covered by the insurance policy. The monthly cost of health insurance premium shall be entered on the Child Support Schedule D -- Additional Expenses in the column of the parent paying the premium.

                <p>General principles. 

(A)  The amount of child support established by this Code section and the presumptive amount of child support are rebuttable and the court or the jury may deviate from the presumptive amount of child support in compliance with this subsection. In deviating from the presumptive amount of child support, consideration shall be given to the best interest of the child for whom support under this Code section is being determined. A nonparent custodian's expenses may be the basis for a deviation as well as a noncustodial parent's ability or inability to pay the presumptive amount of child support.(B)  When ordering a deviation from the presumptive amount of child support, the court or the jury shall consider all available income of the parents and shall make written findings or special interrogatory findings that an amount of child support other than the amount calculated is reasonably necessary to provide for the needs of the child for whom child support is being determined and the order or special interrogatory shall state:</p>

              <p>The reasons for the deviation from the presumptive amount of child support;

(ii)  The amount of child support that would have been required under this Code section if the presumptive amount of child support had not been rebutted; and(iii)  How, in its determination:
(I)  Application of the presumptive amount of child support would be unjust or inappropriate; and

(II)  The best interest of the child for whom support is being determined will be served by deviation from the presumptive amount of child support.

(C)  No deviation in the presumptive amount of child support shall be made which seriously impairs the ability of the custodial parent to maintain minimally adequate housing, food, and clothing for the child being supported by the order and to provide other basic necessities, as determined by the court or the jury.

(D)  If the circumstances which supported the deviation cease to exist, the final order may be modified as set forth in subsection</p>

                <p>Specific deviations. 

      (A)   High income.  For purposes of this subparagraph, parents are considered to be high-income parents if their combined adjusted income exceeds $30,000.00 per month.  For high-income parents, the court shall set the basic child support obligation at the highest amount allowed by the child support obligation table but the court or the jury may consider upward deviation to attain an appropriate award of child support for high-income parents which is consistent with the best interest of the child. 
      (B)   Low income.</p>

              <p>If the noncustodial parent can provide evidence sufficient to demonstrate no earning capacity or that his or her pro rata share of the presumptive amount of child support would create an extreme economic hardship for such parent, the court may consider a low-income deviation.

(ii)  A noncustodial parent whose sole source of income is supplemental security income received under Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act shall be considered to have no earning capacity.

(iii)  The court or the jury shall examine all attributable and excluded sources of income, assets, and benefits available to the noncustodial parent and may consider the noncustodial parent's basic subsistence needs and all of his or her reasonable expenses, ensuring that such expenses are actually paid by the noncustodial parent and are clearly justified expenses.

(iv)  In considering a request for a low-income deviation, the court or the jury shall then weigh the income and all attributable and excluded sources of income, assets, and benefits and all reasonable expenses of each parent, the relative hardship that a reduction in the amount of child support paid to the custodial parent would have on the custodial parent's household, the needs of each parent, the needs of the child for whom child support is being determined, and the ability of the noncustodial parent to pay child support.</p>

              <p>Following a review of the noncustodial parent's gross income and expenses, and taking into account each parent's basic child support obligation adjusted by health insurance and work related child care costs and the relative hardships on the parents and the child, the court or the jury, upon request by either party or upon the court's initiative, may consider a downward deviation to attain an appropriate award of child support which is consistent with the best interest of the child.

(vi)  For the purpose of calculating a low-income deviation, the noncustodial parent's minimum child support for one child shall be not less than $100.00 per month, and such amount shall be increased by at least $50.00 for each additional child for the same case for which child support is being ordered.

(vii)  A low-income deviation granted pursuant to this subparagraph shall apply only to the current child support amount and shall not prohibit an additional amount being ordered to reduce a noncustodial parent's arrears.

(viii)  If a low-income deviation is granted pursuant to this subparagraph, such deviation shall not prohibit the court or jury from granting an increase or decrease to the presumptive amount of child support by the use of any other specific or nonspecific deviation. 

      (C)   Other health related insurance.  If the court or the jury finds that either parent has vision or dental insurance available at a reasonable cost for the child, the court may deviate from the presumptive amount of child support for the cost of such insurance. 

      (D)   Life insurance.  In accordance with Code Section 19-6-34, if the court or the jury finds that either parent has purchased life insurance on the life of either parent or the lives of both parents for the benefit of the child, the court may deviate from the presumptive amount of child support for the cost of such insurance by either adding or subtracting the amount of the premium.

              <p>Extraordinary educational expenses.  Extraordinary educational expenses may be a basis for deviation from the presumptive amount of child support. Extraordinary educational expenses include, but are not limited to, tuition, room and board, lab fees, books, fees, and other reasonable and necessary expenses associated with special needs education or private elementary and secondary schooling that are appropriate to the parent's financial abilities and to the lifestyle of the child if the parents and the child were living together.
(I)  In determining the amount of deviation for extraordinary educational expenses, scholarships, grants, stipends, and other cost-reducing programs received by or on behalf of the child shall be considered; and

(II)  If a deviation is allowed for extraordinary educational expenses, a monthly average of the extraordinary educational expenses shall be based on evidence of prior or anticipated expenses and entered on the Child Support Schedule E -- Deviations. 

         (ii)  Special expenses incurred for child rearing.  Special expenses incurred for child rearing, including, but not limited to, quantifiable expense variations related to the food, clothing, and hygiene costs of children at different age levels, may be a basis for a deviation from the presumptive amount of child support. Such expenses include, but are not limited to, summer camp; music or art lessons; travel; school sponsored extracurricular activities, such as band, clubs, and athletics; and other activities intended to enhance the athletic, social, or cultural development of a child but not otherwise required to be used in calculating the presumptive amount of child support as are health insurance premiums and work related child care costs.

              <p>The judgment of a court providing permanent alimony for the support of a spouse rendered on or after July 1, 1977, shall be subject to revision upon petition filed by either former spouse showing a change in the income and financial status of either former spouse. A petition shall be filed and returnable under the same rules of procedure applicable to divorce proceedings. No petition may be filed by either former spouse under this subsection within a period of two years from the date of the final order on a previous petition by the same former spouse. After hearing both parties and the evidence, the jury, or the judge where a jury is not demanded by either party, may modify and revise the previous judgment, in accordance with the changed income and financial status of either former spouse in the case of permanent alimony for the support of a former spouse, or in accordance with the changed income and financial status of either former spouse if such a change in the income and financial status is satisfactorily proved so as to warrant the modification and revision. In the hearing upon a petition filed as provided in this subsection, testimony may be given and evidence introduced relative to the income and financial status of either former spouse.</p>

              <p>of Code Section 19-6-19, the merits of whether a party is entitled to alimony are not an issue. The only issue is whether there has been such a substantial change in the income and financial status of either former spouse, in cases of permanent alimony for the support of a former spouse, as to warrant either a downward or upward revision or modification of the permanent alimony judgment.

              <p>Whenever, in any foreign country or any other state of the United States, any person obtains a divorce from such person's spouse, which spouse at the time of the filing of the divorce action was a resident of this state, and in the divorce action the spouse was not personally served with petition and process but was served constructively and did not appear, plead, or otherwise waive jurisdiction of the foreign court, the spouse, at any time subsequent to the granting of the foreign divorce decree, may apply to the superior court for an order and judgment for permanent alimony for the support of such spouse and the child or children of the parties, if any. The permanent alimony action shall be filed, pleaded, and tried as if no divorce decree had been entered, even though the foreign decree may be entitled to full faith and credit in dissolving the marriage. If the person who obtained the divorce has become a resident of this state, the action for alimony shall be brought in the county of the person's residence; otherwise, the action shall be brought in the county in which the spouse applying for alimony resides.</p>

Where such a motion is filed, a judgment shall not be automatically divided. A postjudgment hearing shall be conducted by the judge at which each parent shall have the opportunity to be heard and to produce evidence regarding that parent's relationship with the deceased child. The judge shall fairly determine the percentage of the judgment to be awarded to each parent. In making such a determination, the judge shall consider each parent's relationship with the deceased child, including permanent custody, control, and support, as well as any other factors found to be pertinent. The judge's decision shall not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.

              <p>of this Code section, the court may grant any family member of the child reasonable visitation rights if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the health or welfare of the child would be harmed unless such visitation is granted and if the best interests of the child would be served by such visitation. The mere absence of an opportunity for a child to develop a relationship with a family member shall not be considered as harming the health or welfare of the child when there is no substantial preexisting relationship between the child and such family member. In considering whether the health or welfare of the child would be harmed without such visitation, the court shall consider and may find that harm to the child is reasonably likely to result when, prior to the original action or intervention:
(A)  The minor child resided with the family member for six months or more;

(B)  The family member provided financial support for the basic needs of the child for at least one year;

(C)  There was an established pattern of regular visitation or child care by the family member with the child; or(D)  Any other circumstance exists indicating that emotional or physical harm would be reasonably likely to result if such visitation is not granted.
The court shall make specific written findings of fact in support of its rulings.</p>

            <p>§ 19-7-4. Criteria for loss of parental custody
If a child is found under circumstances of destitution and suffering, abandonment, or exposure or if the child has been begging or if it is found that the child is being reared under immoral, obscene, or indecent influences which are likely to degrade his moral character and devote him to a vicious life and it appears to the appropriate court by competent evidence, including such examination of the child as may be practicable, that by reason of the neglect, habitual drunkenness, lewd or other vicious habits, or other behavior of the parents or guardians of the child, it is necessary for the welfare of the child to protect the child from such conditions, the court may order that the parents or guardians be deprived of custody of the child and that appropriate measures as provided by law be taken for the welfare of the child.

Oral reports shall be followed by a later report in writing, if requested, to a child welfare agency providing protective services, as designated by the Division of Family and Children Services of the Department of Human Services, or, in the absence of such agency, to an appropriate police authority or district attorney. If a report of child abuse is made to the child welfare agency or independently discovered by the agency, and the agency has reasonable cause to believe such report is true or the report contains any allegation or evidence of child abuse, then the agency shall immediately notify the appropriate police authority or district attorney. Such reports shall contain the names and addresses of the child and the child's parents or caretakers, if known, the child's age, the nature and extent of the child's injuries, including any evidence of previous injuries, and any other information that the reporting person believes might be helpful in establishing the cause of the injuries and the identity of the perpetrator. Photographs of the child's injuries to be used as documentation in support of allegations by hospital employees or volunteers, physicians, law enforcement personnel, school officials, or employees or volunteers of legally mandated public or private child protective agencies may be taken without the permission of the child's parent or guardian. Such photographs shall be made available as soon as possible to the chief welfare agency providing protective services</p>

              <p>The purpose of this Code section is to provide for the protection of children whose health and welfare are adversely affected and further threatened by the unlawful use and abuse of controlled substances or marijuana. The General Assembly recognizes the need for early intervention, counseling, and treatment as an effective means of addressing the problem of child controlled substance and marijuana abuse. It is intended that the reporting of the unlawful use of any controlled substance or marijuana will cause the protective services of the state to be brought to bear on this situation in an effort to protect and enhance the welfare of children. This Code section shall be liberally construed so as to carry out the purposes thereof.</p>

              <p>of this Code section may be disputed. Where possibility of access exists, the strong presumption is in favor of legitimacy and the proof must be clear to establish the contrary. If pregnancy existed at the time of the marriage and a divorce is sought and obtained on that ground, the child, although born in wedlock, will not be legitimate.</p>

No genetic testing shall be undertaken by the Department of Human Services if the child was adopted either by the applicant for services or other alleged parent or if the child was conceived by means of artificial insemination. The need for genetic testing shall be supported by a sworn statement alleging paternity and setting forth facts establishing a reasonable possibility of the requisite sexual contact between the parties.

              <p>In any case in which the court or the Department of Human Services orders genetic testing and one or both of the parties to the action is receiving child support services pursuant to Code Section 19-11-6, the Department of Human Services shall pay the costs of such tests subject to recoupment from the alleged father if paternity is established. If the genetic test excludes the possibility of the alleged father being the biological father, then the applicant for services who named the alleged father shall be liable to the Department of Human Services for reimbursement of the paternity testing fee. Upon completion of the first test, but prior to the entry of any order, a second genetic test shall be ordered if the person making the request tenders payment in full of the cost of the initial test as well as the cost of the second test at the time of the request. Any party who, after notice sent by mail to his or her last known address, fails to cooperate with paternity testing or fails to make any child available for paternity testing may be sanctioned by the Department of Human Services. Such sanctions may include but shall not be limited to loss of the opportunity for paternity testing, loss of state benefits, denial of services, and administrative case closure. The Department of Human Services may bring a petition for contempt in the event of such noncooperation in violation of any court order.

If the case is still in default after the expiration of the period of 15 days, the plaintiff at any time thereafter shall be entitled to verdict and judgment by default, in open court or in chambers, as if every item and paragraph of the complaint or other original pleading were supported by proper evidence.

                <p>(A) The biological father who is not the legal father of a child may execute a surrender of his rights to the child prior to the birth of the child for the purpose of an adoption pursuant to this Code section. A pre-birth surrender, when signed under oath by the alleged biological father, shall serve to relinquish the alleged biological father's rights to the child and to waive the alleged biological father's right to notice of any proceeding with respect to the child's adoption, custody, or guardianship. The court in any adoption proceeding shall have jurisdiction to enter a final order of adoption of the child based upon the pre-birth surrender and in other proceedings to determine the child's legal custody or guardianship shall have jurisdiction to enter an order for those purposes.
(B)  The responsibilities of an alleged biological father are permanently terminated only upon the entry of a final order of adoption. A person executing a pre-birth surrender pursuant to this Code section shall have the right to withdraw the surrender within ten days from the date of execution thereof, notwithstanding the date of birth of the child.

(C)  If a final order of adoption is not entered after the execution of a pre-birth surrender and paternity is established by acknowledgment, by administrative order, or by judicial order, then the alleged biological father shall be responsible for child support or other financial obligations to the child or to the child's mother, or to both.

(D)  The pre-birth surrender shall not be valid for use by a legal father as defined under paragraph</p>

(E)  The pre-birth surrender may be executed at any time after the biological mother executes a sworn statement identifying such person as an alleged biological father of the biological mother's unborn child.

(F)  The pre-birth surrender shall meet the requirements of subsection</p>

                <p>(A) The biological father who is not the legal father of a child may execute a surrender of his rights to the child prior to the birth of the child for the purpose of an adoption pursuant to this Code section. A pre-birth surrender, when signed under oath by the alleged biological father, shall serve to relinquish the alleged biological father's rights to the child and to waive the alleged biological father's right to notice of any proceeding with respect to the child's adoption, custody, or guardianship. The court in any adoption proceeding shall have jurisdiction to enter a final order of adoption of the child based upon the pre-birth surrender and in other proceedings to determine the child's legal custody or guardianship shall have jurisdiction to enter an order for those purposes.
(B)  The responsibilities of an alleged biological father are permanently terminated only upon the entry of a final order of adoption. A person executing a pre-birth surrender pursuant to this Code section shall have the right to withdraw the surrender within ten days from the date of execution thereof, notwithstanding the date of birth of the child.

(C)  If a final order of adoption is not entered after the execution of a pre-birth surrender and paternity is established by acknowledgment, by administrative order, or by judicial order, then the alleged biological father shall be responsible for child support or other financial obligations to the child or to the child's mother, or to both.

(D)  The pre-birth surrender shall not be valid for use by a legal father as defined under paragraph</p>

(E)  The pre-birth surrender may be executed at any time after the biological mother executes a sworn statement identifying such person as an alleged biological father of the biological mother's unborn child.

(F)  The pre-birth surrender shall meet the requirements of subsection</p>

                <p>(A) The biological father who is not the legal father of a child may execute a surrender of his rights to the child prior to the birth of the child for the purpose of an adoption pursuant to this Code section. A pre-birth surrender, when signed under oath by the alleged biological father, shall serve to relinquish the alleged biological father's rights to the child and to waive the alleged biological father's right to notice of any proceeding with respect to the child's adoption, custody, or guardianship. The court in any adoption proceeding shall have jurisdiction to enter a final order of adoption of the child based upon the pre-birth surrender and in other proceedings to determine the child's legal custody or guardianship shall have jurisdiction to enter an order for those purposes.
(B)  The responsibilities of an alleged biological father are permanently terminated only upon the entry of a final order of adoption. A person executing a pre-birth surrender pursuant to this Code section shall have the right to withdraw the surrender within ten days from the date of execution thereof, notwithstanding the date of birth of the child.

(C)  If a final order of adoption is not entered after the execution of a pre-birth surrender and paternity is established by acknowledgment, by administrative order, or by judicial order, then the alleged biological father shall be responsible for child support or other financial obligations to the child or to the child's mother, or to both.

(D)  The pre-birth surrender shall not be valid for use by a legal father as defined under paragraph</p>

(E)  The pre-birth surrender may be executed at any time after the biological mother executes a sworn statement identifying such person as an alleged biological father of the biological mother's unborn child.

(F)  The pre-birth surrender shall meet the requirements of subsection</p>

              <p>If the child sought to be adopted has no legal father or legal mother living, it shall be the privilege of any person related by blood to the child to file objections to the petition for adoption. A family member with visitation rights to a child granted pursuant to Code Section 19-7-3 shall have the privilege to file objections to the petition of adoption if neither parent has any further rights to the child and if the petition for adoption has been filed by a blood relative of the child. The court, after hearing such objections, shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not the same constitute a good reason for denying the petition and the court shall have the authority to grant or continue such visitation rights of the family member of the child in the adoption order in the event the adoption by the blood relative is approved by the court.

              <p>Adult persons may be adopted on giving written consent to the adoption. In such cases, adoption shall be by a petition duly verified and filed, together with two conformed copies, in the superior court in the county in which either any petitioner or the adult to be adopted resides, setting forth the name, age, and residence of each petitioner and of the adult to be adopted, the name by which the adult is to be known, and his written consent to the adoption. The court may assign the petition for hearing at any time. After examining each petitioner and the adult sought to be adopted, the court, if satisfied that there is no reason why the adoption should not be granted, shall enter a decree of adoption and, if requested, shall change the name of the adopted adult. Thereafter, the relation between each petitioner and the adopted adult shall be, as to their legal rights and liabilities, the relation of parent and child.</p>

Upon the written consent of a sibling so notified, the department or the placement agency shall forward the requesting party's name and address to the sibling and, upon further written consent of the sibling, shall divulge to the requesting party the present name and address of the sibling. If a sibling cannot be identified or located, the department or placement agency shall notify the requesting party of such circumstances but shall not disclose any names or other information which would tend to identify the sibling. If a sibling is deceased, the department or placement agency shall be authorized to disclose the name and place of burial of the deceased sibling, if known, to the requesting party without the necessity of obtaining a court order.(B)</p>

              <p>If six months after receipt of the written request from an adopted individual who has reached 18 years of age or an individual who has reached 18 years of age and who is the sibling of an adopted individual, the department or placement agency has been unable to notify one or more of the siblings of the requesting party or has been able to notify a sibling of the requesting party but has not obtained a consent to disclosure from the notified sibling, then the identity of the siblings may only be disclosed as provided in division (ii) of this subparagraph.

(ii)  The adopted person who has reached 21 years of age or a person who has reached 21 years of age and who is the sibling of an adopted person may petition the Superior Court of Fulton County to seek the release of the last known name and address of each of the siblings of the petitioning sibling, that are at least 18 years of age, from the department or placement agency. The court shall grant the petition if the court finds that the department or placement agency has made diligent efforts to locate such siblings pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph either without success or upon locating one or more of the siblings has not obtained a consent to disclosure from all the notified siblings and that failure to release the identity and last known address of said siblings would have an adverse impact upon the physical, mental, or emotional health of the petitioning sibling.

(C)  If the adopted person is deceased and leaves a child, such child, upon reaching 21 years of age, may obtain the name and other identifying information concerning the siblings of his or her deceased parent in the same manner that the deceased adopted person would be entitled to obtain such information pursuant to the procedures contained in this Code section.</p>

FINAL RELEASE FOR ADOPTION 

NOTICE TO ALLEGED BIOLOGICAL FATHER: 

This is an important legal document and by signing it you are surrendering any and all of your right, title, and claim to the child identified herein, so as to facilitate the child's placement for adoption.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, the child has not been born as of the date I am signing this pre-birth surrender; however, if in fact the child has been born, this surrender shall have the same effect as if it were a surrender executed following the birth of the child.

I understand that by signing this document I am not admitting that I am the biological father of this child, but if I am, I hereby agree that adoption is in this child's best interest. I consent to adoption of this child by any person chosen by the child's mother or by any public or private child-placing agency without further notice to me. I expressly waive any other notice or service in any of the legal proceedings for the adoption of the child.

I understand that I have the option to wait until after the child is born to execute a surrende</p>

                <p>(A) A biological father who is not a legal father of a child may execute a surrender of his rights to the child prior to the birth of the child for the purpose of an adoption pursuant to this Code section.  A pre-birth surrender shall serve to relinquish an alleged biological father's rights to the child and to waive an alleged biological father's right to notice of any proceeding with respect to the child's adoption, custody, or guardianship.  The court in any adoption proceeding shall have jurisdiction to enter a final order of adoption of the child based upon the pre-birth surrender and in other proceedings to determine the child's legal custody or guardianship shall have jurisdiction to enter an order for those purposes.
(B)  The rights and responsibilities of an alleged biological father shall be permanently terminated only upon an order from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating such rights or the entry of a final order of adoption.  An individual executing a pre-birth surrender pursuant to this Code section shall have the right to revoke such surrender within four days from the date of execution thereof, notwithstanding the date of birth of the child.

(C)  If a final order of adoption is not entered after the execution of a pre-birth surrender and paternity is established by acknowledgment, by administrative order, or by judicial order, then an alleged biological father shall be responsible for child support or other financial obligations to the child or to a legal mother, or to both.

(D)  The pre-birth surrender shall not be valid for use by a legal father.

(E)  The pre-birth surrender may be executed at any time after the biological mother executes a sworn statement identifying such individual as an alleged biological father of the biological mother's unborn child meeting the requirements of subsection</p>

                <p>(A) A biological father who is not a legal father of a child may execute a surrender of his rights to the child prior to the birth of the child for the purpose of an adoption pursuant to this Code section.  A pre-birth surrender shall serve to relinquish an alleged biological father's rights to the child and to waive an alleged biological father's right to notice of any proceeding with respect to the child's adoption, custody, or guardianship.  The court in any adoption proceeding shall have jurisdiction to enter a final order of adoption of the child based upon the pre-birth surrender and in other proceedings to determine the child's legal custody or guardianship shall have jurisdiction to enter an order for those purposes.
(B)  The rights and responsibilities of an alleged biological father shall be permanently terminated only upon an order from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating such rights or the entry of a final order of adoption.  An individual executing a pre-birth surrender pursuant to this Code section shall have the right to revoke such surrender within four days from the date of execution thereof, notwithstanding the date of birth of the child.

(C)  If a final order of adoption is not entered after the execution of a pre-birth surrender and paternity is established by acknowledgment, by administrative order, or by judicial order, then an alleged biological father shall be responsible for child support or other financial obligations to the child or to a legal mother, or to both.

(D)  The pre-birth surrender shall not be valid for use by a legal father.

(E)  The pre-birth surrender may be executed at any time after the biological mother executes a sworn statement identifying such individual as an alleged biological father of the biological mother's unborn child meeting the requirements of subsection</p>

                <p>(A) A biological father who is not a legal father of a child may execute a surrender of his rights to the child prior to the birth of the child for the purpose of an adoption pursuant to this Code section.  A pre-birth surrender shall serve to relinquish an alleged biological father's rights to the child and to waive an alleged biological father's right to notice of any proceeding with respect to the child's adoption, custody, or guardianship.  The court in any adoption proceeding shall have jurisdiction to enter a final order of adoption of the child based upon the pre-birth surrender and in other proceedings to determine the child's legal custody or guardianship shall have jurisdiction to enter an order for those purposes.
(B)  The rights and responsibilities of an alleged biological father shall be permanently terminated only upon an order from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating such rights or the entry of a final order of adoption.  An individual executing a pre-birth surrender pursuant to this Code section shall have the right to revoke such surrender within four days from the date of execution thereof, notwithstanding the date of birth of the child.

(C)  If a final order of adoption is not entered after the execution of a pre-birth surrender and paternity is established by acknowledgment, by administrative order, or by judicial order, then an alleged biological father shall be responsible for child support or other financial obligations to the child or to a legal mother, or to both.

(D)  The pre-birth surrender shall not be valid for use by a legal father.

(E)  The pre-birth surrender may be executed at any time after the biological mother executes a sworn statement identifying such individual as an alleged biological father of the biological mother's unborn child meeting the requirements of subsection</p>

If service cannot be made by these methods, such parent shall be given notice by publication once a week for three weeks in the official organ of the county where such petition has been filed and of the county of his or her last known address.  In the interest of time, publication may be initiated simultaneously with efforts to perfect service personally, by registered mail, or by statutory overnight delivery.  The court shall continue to have the inherent authority to determine the sufficiency of service.  A parent who receives notification pursuant to this paragraph shall not be a party to the adoption and shall have no obligation to file an answer, but shall have the right to appear in the pending termination of parental rights proceeding and show cause why such parent's rights to the child who is the subject of the proceeding should not be terminated.  Notice shall be deemed to have been received on the earliest date:
(A)  Personal service is perfected;

(B)  Of delivery shown on the return receipt of registered mail or proof of delivery by statutory overnight delivery; or(C)  Of the last publication.</p>

              <p>A family member with visitation rights to a child granted pursuant to Code Section 19-7-3 shall have the privilege to file objections to the petition for adoption if neither parent has any further rights to the child and if the petition for adoption has been filed by a blood relative of the child.  The court, after hearing such objections, shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not such objections constitute a good reason for denying the petition for adoption and the court shall have the authority to grant or continue such visitation rights of the family member of the child in the adoption order in the event the adoption by the blood relative is approved by the court.

              <p>Adult individuals may be adopted on giving written consent to the adoption.  In such cases, adoption shall be by a petition duly verified and filed, together with one conformed copy, in the superior court in the county in which any petitioner or the adult to be adopted resides, setting forth the name, age, and residence of each petitioner and of the adult to be adopted, the name by which the adult is to be known, and his or her written consent to the adoption.  The court may assign the petition for adoption for hearing at any time.  The petition for adoption shall state whether one or both parents of the adult to be adopted will be replaced by the grant of such petition, and if only one parent is to be replaced, then the decree of adoption shall make clear which parent is to be replaced by adoption.  After examining each petitioner and the adult to be adopted, the court, if satisfied that there is no reason why the adoption should not be granted, shall enter a decree of adoption and, if requested, shall change the name of the adopted adult.  Thereafter, the relation between each petitioner and the adopted adult shall be, as to their legal rights and liabilities, the same as the relation of a parent and adult child.</p>

              <p>A legal embryo custodian may relinquish all rights and responsibilities for an embryo to a recipient intended parent prior to embryo transfer.

The contract shall be signed by each legal embryo custodian for such embryo and by each recipient intended parent in the presence of a notary public and a witness. Initials or other designations may be used if the parties desire anonymity. The contract may include a written waiver by the legal embryo custodian of notice and service in any legal adoption or other parentage proceeding which may follow.</p>

            <p>§ 19-9-1.1. Binding arbitration on issue of child custody and related matters
In all proceedings under this article, it shall be expressly permissible for the parents of a child to agree to binding arbitration on the issue of child custody and matters relative to visitation, parenting time, and a parenting plan. The parents may select their arbiter and decide which issues will be resolved in binding arbitration. The arbiter's decisions shall be incorporated into a final decree awarding child custody unless the judge makes specific written factual findings that under the circumstances of the parents and the child the arbiter's award would not be in the best interests of the child. In its judgment, the judge may supplement the arbiter's decision on issues not covered by the binding arbitration.

(G)  The importance of continuity in the child's life and the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity;

(H)  The stability of the family unit of each of the parents and the presence or absence of each parent's support systems within the community to benefit the child;

(I)  The mental and physical health of each parent;

(B)  The judge shall consider the perpetrator's history of causing physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or causing reasonable fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or assault to another person;

(C)  If a parent is absent or relocates because of an act of domestic violence by the other parent, such absence or relocation for a reasonable period of time in the circumstances shall not be deemed an abandonment of the child for the purposes of custody determination; and

(D)  The judge shall not refuse to consider relevant or otherwise admissible evidence of acts of family violence merely because there has been no previous finding of family violence. The judge may, in addition to other appropriate actions, order supervised visitation or parenting time pursuant to Code Section 19-9-7.</p>

                <p>A military parent shall ensure that any military family care plan that he or she has filed with his or her commander is consistent with any existing court orders for his or her child. In all instances any court order will be the first course of action for the care of a child during the absence of a military parent, and the military family care plan will be the alternative plan if the nondeploying parent either refuses to provide care for the child or acknowledges an inability to provide reasonable care for the child. A military parent shall not be considered in contempt of any court order or parenting plan when he or she in good faith implements his or her military family care plan based upon the refusal or claimed inability of a nondeploying parent to provide reasonable care for a child during a deployment.

              <p>On motion of either party in any action or proceeding involving determination of the award of child custody between parents of the child, when such motion contains a specific recitation of actual abuse, neglect, or other overt acts which have adversely affected the health and welfare of the child, the judge may direct the appropriate family and children services agency or any other appropriate entity to investigate the home life and home environment of each of the parents. In any action or proceeding involving determination of the award of child custody between parents of the child when during such proceedings a specific recitation of actual abuse, neglect, or other overt acts which have adversely affected the health and welfare of the child has been made the judge shall also have authority on his or her own motion to order such an investigation if in the judge's opinion the investigation would be useful in determining placement or custody of the child. The judge may also direct either party to pay to the agency the reasonable cost, or any portion thereof, of the investigation. The report of the investigation will be made to the judge directing the investigation. Any report made at the direction of the judge shall be made available to either or both parties for a reasonable period of time prior to the proceedings at which any temporary or permanent custody is to be determined. Both parties shall have the right to confront and cross-examine the person or persons who conducted the investigation or compiled the report if adequate and legal notice is given.</p>

            <p>§ 19-9-6. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Armed forces" means the national guard and the reserve components of the armed forces, the United States army, navy, marine corps, coast guard, and air force.

(2)  "Deploy" or "deployment" means military service in compliance with the military orders received by a member of the armed forces to report for combat operations, contingency operations, peacekeeping operations, a remote tour of duty, temporary duty, or other such military service for which a parent is required to report unaccompanied by family members. Deployment shall include the period during which a military parent remains subject to deployment orders and remains deployed on account of sickness, wounds, leave, or other lawful cause. Such term shall include mobilization.

(3)  "Deploying parent" or "deployed parent" means a military parent who has been formally notified by military leadership that he or she will deploy or mobilize or who is currently deployed or mobilized.

(4)  "Joint custody" means joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or both joint legal custody and joint physical custody. In making an order for joint custody, the judge may order joint legal custody without ordering joint physical custody.

(5)  "Joint legal custody" means both parents have equal rights and responsibilities for major decisions concerning the child, including the child's education, health care, extracurricular activities, and religious training; provided, however, that the judge may designate one parent to have sole power to make certain decisions while both parents retain equal rights and responsibilities for other decisions.

(6)  "Joint physical custody" means that physical custody is shared by the parents in such a way as to assure the child of substantially equal time and contact with both parents.

(7)  "Military family care plan" means a plan that is periodically reviewed by a military parent's commander that provides for care of a military parent's child whenever his or her military duties prevent such parent from providing care to his or her child and ensures that a military parent has made adequate and reasonable arrangements to provide for the needs and supervision of his or her child whenever a nondeploying parent is unable or unavailable to provide care in the military parent's absence.

(8)  "Military parent" means a member of the armed forces who is a legal parent, adoptive parent, or guardian of a child under the age of 18, whose parental rights are established either by operation of law or the process of legitimation, and who has not had his or her parental rights terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(9)  "Mobilization" or "mobilize" means the call-up of the national guard and the reserve components of the armed forces to extended active duty service. Such term shall not include National Guard or Reserves component annual training, inactive duty days, drill weekends, or state active duty performed within the boundaries of this state.(10)  "Nondeploying parent" means:
(A)  A parent who is not a member of the armed forces; or

(B)  A military parent who is currently not also a deploying parent.

(11)  "Sole custody" means a person, including, but not limited to, a parent, has been awarded permanent custody of a child by a court order. Unless otherwise provided by court order, the person awarded sole custody of a child shall have the rights and responsibilities for major decisions concerning the child, including the child's education, health care, extracurricular activities, and religious training, and the noncustodial parent shall have the right to visitation or parenting time. A person who has not been awarded custody of a child by court order shall not be considered as the sole legal custodian while exercising visitation rights or parenting time.

(12)  "State active duty" means the call-up by a governor for the performance of any military duty while serving within the boundaries of that state.

(13)  "Temporary duty" means the assignment of a military parent to a geographic location outside of this state for a limited period of time to accomplish training or to assist in the performance of a military mission.

            <p>§ 19-9-22. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Custody" includes visitation rights.

(2)  "Legal custodian" means a person, including, but not limited to, a parent, who has been awarded permanent custody of a child by a court order. A person who has not been awarded custody of a child by court order shall not be considered as the legal custodian while exercising visitation rights. Where custody of a child is shared by two or more persons or where the time of visitation exceeds the time of custody, that person who has the majority of time of custody or visitation shall be the legal custodian.

(3)  "Physical custodian" means a person, including, but not limited to, a parent, who is not the "legal custodian" of a child but who has physical custody of the child.
