          <p>If judgment shall be rendered for the plaintiff in any action brought pursuant to Code Section 44-2-193, execution shall issue against any defendants other than the state treasurer. If such execution is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or if there are no such defendants, the clerk of the court in which the judgment was rendered shall certify to the state treasurer the amount due on the judgment; and the same shall be paid by the state treasurer out of the assurance fund under the special appropriation made of the fund for such purpose. Any person other than the state treasurer against whom any such judgment may have been rendered shall remain liable therefor or for so much thereof as may be paid out of the assurance fund; and the state treasurer may bring action at any time to enforce the lien of such judgment against such person or his estate for the recovery of the amount, with interest, paid out of the assurance fund.</p>
