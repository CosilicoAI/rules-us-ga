          <p>In all cases where a deed to land has been executed to secure a debt or the performance of an obligation and the grantor therein is or becomes thereafter liable to the process of attachment, an attachment may issue against him at the instance of the payee, assignee, or holder of the debt or obligation upon his compliance with the provisions of law relating to attachments. The attachment shall be levied upon the land described in the deed, and the subsequent proceedings shall be in all respects as prescribed by law in relation to attachments. The holder of the legal title of the land described in the deed or, if dead, his executor or administrator may make and execute, without order of any court, for the purpose of levy and sale after the rendition of judgment in attachment and the issuance of execution thereon, a quitclaim deed of conveyance of the land to the grantor in the deed and may file the same for record in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the land is located. When a judgment is obtained upon the attachment and the deed is so filed and recorded, the execution issued upon the judgment may be levied upon the land and the land may be sold as other property of the defendant. The proceeds arising from the sale shall be applied to the payment of the judgment or, if there are conflicting claims, the proceeds shall be applied as determined in proceedings had for that purpose; provided, however, this Code section shall not apply unless the debt or debts or liabilities so secured have become due under the terms of the contract creating the obligation or obligations.</p>
