              <p>Persons, firms, or corporations submitting bids on department construction contracts are required to examine the site of the proposed work and determine for themselves the anticipated subsurface and latent physical conditions at the site prior to submitting a bid on the project. The submission of a bid shall be prima-facie evidence that the bidder has made such examination and is satisfied as to the conditions to be encountered in performing the work. The department does not in any way guarantee the amount or nature of subsurface materials which may be encountered and which must be excavated, graded, or driven through in performing the work on the project. The contractor shall not plead deception or misunderstanding because of variations from quantities of work to be performed or materials to be furnished as shown on the plans or minor variations from the locations or character of the work. Payment will be made only for actual quantities of work performed in accordance with the plans and specifications. The department shall not provide compensation above the amount bid on such project solely due to the encountering of subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which are different from those anticipated by the bidder.</p>

The advertising of all nonnegotiated department construction contracts shall have the prior approval of the board. When the board is not in session, the commissioner may approve negotiated construction contracts. In determining public roads most in need of work and also the type, class, width, location, and order of priority of each project, the board shall take into consideration such factors as the use of the public road in question; the present need and anticipated development of the area traversed by it; whether or not it is a school bus or mail route; and its use for agricultural or industrial purposes. The board shall also take into consideration the information disclosed by the records required by Code Section 32-4-2 to be maintained by the department.

            <p>§ 32-2-66. Prequalifications of contractors and subcontractorsIn order to establish a list of reliable persons qualified to bid on a department contract or to subcontract with such persons and to ensure that the contract may be awarded to the lowest reliable bidder, the department may adopt and publish in print or electronically uniform and reasonable rules and regulations which may include but not be limited to the following:
(1)  A requirement that every contractor desiring to be qualified to bid or subcontract file with the department an application including, among other information: a financial statement; a complete questionnaire regarding the contractor's organization and the work performed by such contractor; and a statement of equipment owned or leased by such contractor;

(2)  Conditions under which a contractor or subcontractor may become disqualified to bid or to subcontract;

(3)  Procedures for assigning maximum capacity ratings to contractors and subcontractors; and

(4)  Provisions for waiving prequalification of contractors for construction of specialty items. For the purpose of this paragraph, "specialty items" means work that requires highly specialized knowledge, craftsmanship, or equipment not ordinarily available in the type of contracting organizations qualified and expected to bid on the contract as a whole.

              <p>An appeal having been filed as provided in Code Section 32-3-14, the appellant or appellants, at any time before the beginning of the trial of the issue formed on such appeal, but not later than 90 days after the date of service as provided in Code Sections 32-3-8 and 32-3-9, may file in the case a petition for an interlocutory hearing on the issue of whether the amount deposited in court as just and adequate compensation is sufficient. Such petition shall be served as may be directed by the court. The petition shall be verified and shall state the amount which is claimed by the petitioner to represent just and adequate compensation, together with a sworn, written statement of the facts upon which the claim is based.</p>

              <p>Upon the presentation of the interlocutory petition to the judge of the court in which the case is pending, the court shall make such order as to the appointment of assessors as shall conform most nearly to Article 1 of Chapter 2 of Title 22 and shall give all interested persons equal rights in the selection thereof. If by reason of conflicting interests or otherwise such equality of right cannot be preserved, the judge shall make such order on the subject as shall secure a fair and impartial assessment. The board of assessors so appointed shall determine from all evidence offered by the parties, from personal inspection of the premises, and from its own professional judgment whether the condemnor should be required to deposit any additional amount as estimated compensation and shall, within 30 days of the date of reference to such board, make an interlocutory award based upon such determination.</p>

Such bond shall be executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this state; and, in the event the amount awarded by the jury on final trial of the appeal is less than the total amount paid into court by the condemnor, judgment may be entered against the principal and surety on the bond for the amount by which the total amount paid into court exceeds the amount awarded by the jury; and, if the amount awarded by the jury is less than the original deposit, judgment may be entered against the condemnee for that part of the judgment not covered by the bond.</p>

              <p>The lands and interest in lands to be acquired in fee simple for federal parkway rights of way shall average not more than 125 acres per mile plus not more than 25 acres per mile in scenic easements; and in no case shall the width of the fee simple rights of way for federal parkway land be less than 300 feet. It is the intent of this Code section that in using the acreage per mile method there will be permitted the balancing of the total acreage over the entire length of the federal parkway project within the state and that such usage will provide for flexibility to narrow or widen the fee simple lands acquired for federal parkways to meet specific conditions.</p>

            <p>§ 32-4-1. Classification of public roadsFor purposes of jurisdiction and administration, the public roads of Georgia shall be divided and classified in accordance with the three types of classifications provided in this Code section:
(1)  State highway system.  The state highway system shall consist of those public roads which on July 1, 1973, are shown by the records of the department to be "state-aid roads," those public roads thereafter designated by the department as part of the state highway system, and all of The Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways within the state;
(2)  County road systems.  Each county road system shall consist of those public roads within that county, including county roads extending into any municipality within the county, which are shown to be part of that county road system by the department records on July 1, 1973, and any subsequent additions to such county road system made by the county;

(3)  Municipal street systems.  Each municipal street system shall consist of those public roads within the limits of that municipality which are not in any other classification under this Code section.

However, nothing contained in this Code section shall prevent the department from using the State Public Transportation Fund to acquire such right of way, to pay any damage awarded on account of the location of any road that is a part of the state highway system, or to assist a county or municipality in so doing. Furthermore, nothing in this Code section shall be construed to authorize an expenditure from the State Public Transportation Fund for the procurement of a right of way for a road to be constructed on a county road system or municipal street system except as otherwise provided by law or by agreement between the federal government and the department.

              <p>The department may close or limit access to any portion of road on the state highway system due to a declared state of emergency for inclement weather conditions that results in dangerous driving conditions. There shall be erected or posted signage of adequate size indicating that a portion of the state highway system has been closed or access has been limited. When the department determines a road shall have limited access due to a declared state of emergency for inclement winter weather conditions, notice shall be given to motorists through posted signage that motor vehicles must be equipped with tire chains, four-wheel drive with adequate tires for existing conditions, or snow tires with a manufacturer's all weather rating in order to proceed. Such signage shall inform motorists that it shall be unlawful to proceed on such road without such equipment. With the exception of buses, operators of commercial motor vehicles as defined by Code Section 40-1-1 with four or more drive wheels traveling on a road declared as limited access due to a declared state of emergency for inclement winter weather conditions shall affix tire chains to each of the outermost drive wheel tires. Bus and motor coach operators shall affix tire chains to at least two of the drive wheel tires before proceeding on a road with limited access due to a declared state of emergency for inclement winter weather conditions. For purposes of this Code section, the term "tire chains" means metal chains which consist of two circular metal loops, positioned on each side of a tire, connected by not less than nine evenly spaced chains across the tire tread or any other traction devices as provided for by rules and regulations of the commissioner of public safety.</p>

Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways. However, vehicles transporting portable buildings and vehicles not exceeding 65 feet in length transporting boats on roads not a part of The Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, regardless of whether the nature of such buildings or boats is such that they can be readily dismantled or separated, may exceed the lengths and widths established in this article, provided that a special permit for such purposes has been issued as provided in this Code section, but no such special permit shall be issued for a load exceeding 12 feet in width when such load may be readily dismantled or separated. A truck tractor and low boy type trailer may, after depositing its permitted load, return to its point of origin on the authorization of its original permit.

            <p>§ 32-6-113. Design of limited-access roads
Limited-access roads may be so designed as to regulate, restrict, or prohibit access thereto so as to best serve the traffic for which such facility is intended. The authority designating and establishing any limited-access road is authorized to divide and separate such highway into separate roadways by the construction of raised curbings, central dividing sections, or other physical separations or by designating such separate roadways by signs, markers, or stripes; to designate the proper lanes for traffic moving in opposite directions; and to prohibit the making of turns at specified points. The designating authority may recommend to the commissioner of public safety or, if the roads in question are in a municipality, to the municipality that there be fixed on such roads and on the separate lanes thereof such rates of speed as are deemed in the public interest. No person shall have any right of ingress to or egress from or passage across any limited-access road to or from abutting lands except at the designated points to which access may be permitted and under such arrangements and conditions as may be specified from time to time.

The department, a county, or a municipality may designate and establish limited-access roads as new or additional facilities or may designate or establish existing public roads to be limited-access roads. The department or the counties or municipalities shall have authority to provide for the elimination of intersections at grade of limited-access highways with existing state, county, or municipal public roads or railroad rights of way by grade separation or local service roads or by closing off such roads or streets at the right of way boundary line of such limited-access road. After the establishment of any limited-access road, no public road which is not a part of such facility shall intersect the same at grade. No public road shall be opened into or connected with any established limited-access road without the consent of the governmental authority having jurisdiction of such limited-access road, in the same manner as such governmental units are authorized by law.

            <p>§ 32-6-242. Screening junkyards in existence on April 6, 1967
Any junkyard lawfully in existence on April 6, 1967, which is within 1,000 feet of the nearest edge of the right of way and visible from the main traveled way of any public road on the interstate or primary system, shall, whenever feasible, be screened by the department if such road is on the state highway system, otherwise by the county or municipal government having jurisdiction, so as not to be visible from such public road. Such junkyards may be screened at locations either on the right of way of such public road or on property acquired by the department for that purpose outside such right of way. Whenever the commissioner determines that it is in the best interest of the state, the department may acquire, pursuant to any of the procedures for property acquisition set forth in Article 1 of Chapter 3 of this title, such property or interests therein outside existing public road rights of way as may be necessary to provide adequate screening of such junkyards.

Any junkyard which comes into existence after April 6, 1967, the establishment, operation, or maintenance of which is made unlawful by Code Section 32-6-241, is declared to be a public and private nuisance and may be forthwith removed, obliterated, or abated at the order of the commissioner. The department may then submit by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery a statement of the expenses of such removal, obliteration, or abatement to the person owning or operating such junkyard; and, if payment is not made to the department within 60 days of receipt thereof, the department shall certify the amount for collection to the Attorney General.

            <p>§ 32-7-3. Authority of department, counties, and municipalities to dispose of property no longer needed for public road purposes
Whenever any property has been acquired in any manner by the department, a county, or a municipality for public road purposes and thereafter the department, county, or municipality determines that all or any part of the property or any interest therein is no longer needed for such purposes because of changed conditions, the department or the county or municipality is authorized to dispose of such property or such interest therein in accordance with Code Section 32-7-4. Any disposition of property acquired for utility relocation, as provided for in Code Section 32-6-172, or on which utilities are located shall not be subject to Code Section 32-7-4; and no provision of this title shall be construed to prevent the department from conveying to the federal government land or interests in land acquired for federal parkways in Georgia, as provided in Article 2 of Chapter 3 of this title.

                <p>In disposing of property, as authorized under Code Section 32-7-3, the department, a county, or a municipality, provided that such department, county, or municipality has held title to the property for no more than 30 years, shall notify the owner of such property at the time of its acquisition or, if the tract from which the department, a county, or a municipality acquired its property has been subsequently sold, shall notify the owner of abutting land holding title through the owner from whom the department, a county, or a municipality acquired its property. In the event that all or a portion of the property subject to disposition is a roadway located in a subdivision with a duly formed property owner's association, the notice for that roadway portion of the property within such subdivision may be provided to the association in lieu of the individual owners of abutting land. The notice shall be in writing delivered to the appropriate owner or association or by publication if the owner's or association's address is unknown; and the owner or the association, as applicable, shall have the right to acquire, as provided in this subsection, the property with respect to which the notice is given. Publication, if necessary, shall be in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the property is located. If, after a search of the available public records, the address of any interested party cannot be found, a record of the facts and reciting the steps taken to establish the address of any such person shall be placed in the department, county, or municipal records and shall be accepted in lieu of service of notice by mailing the same to the last known address of such person. After properly completing and documenting the search, the department, county, or municipality may dispose of the property in accordance with the provisions of subsection</p>

Such property shall only be used for the purposes of providing parking and shall not be subleased without the department's prior approval. Plans for the use of said property must be submitted to and approved by the department prior to any construction. Regardless of any financial expenditures by the lessee, no lease granted under this subsection shall merge into and become a property interest of the lessee or a sublessee. The department shall reserve the right to terminate any lease without cause upon 30 days' written notice to the lessee. Notwithstanding any provisions of Code Section 48-2-17, all net revenues derived from the lease of any of the department's property used for the purposes of providing parking shall be utilized by the department to offset the cost of maintaining the public roads of the state.</p>
