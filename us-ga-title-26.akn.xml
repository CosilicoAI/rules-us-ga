            <p>§ 26-2-26. When food deemed adulteratedA food shall be deemed to be adulterated if:
(1)  It bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but, in case the substance is not an added substance, such food shall not be considered adulterated under this paragraph if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health;

(2)  It bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance which is unsafe within the meaning of Code Section 26-2-27. In regard to pesticide residues, a food shall be deemed to be adulterated and unsafe if it bears a pesticide residue in excess of a tolerance established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or if it bears a residue of a pesticide for which no tolerance has been established or is currently in effect for that food, if such residue appears at a level which is readily quantifiable by methods of assay for pesticide residues employed by the Commissioner on the date of the assay;

(3)  It consists in whole or in part of a diseased or contaminated, filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance or if it is otherwise unfit for food;

(4)  It has been produced, prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth or whereby it may have been rendered diseased, unwholesome, or injurious to health;

(5)  It is the product of a diseased animal or an animal that has died otherwise than by slaughter or an animal that has been fed upon the uncooked offal from a slaughterhouse;

(6)  Its container is composed in whole or in part of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health;

(7)  Any valuable constituent has been in whole or in part omitted or abstracted therefrom;

(8)  Any substance has been substituted wholly or in part therefor;

(9)  Damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner;

(10)  Any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight or reduce its quality or strength or make it appear better or of greater value than it is;

(11)  It is confectionary and it bears or contains any alcohol or nonnutritive article or substance except harmless coloring, harmless flavoring, harmless resinous glaze not in excess of four-tenths of 1 percent, harmless natural wax not in excess of four-tenths of 1 percent, harmless natural gum, and pectin, provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any confection containing less than one-half of 1 percent by volume of alcohol derived solely from the use of flavoring extracts or to any chewing gum by reason of its containing harmless nonnutritive masticatory substances; or

(12)  It bears or contains a coal-tar color other than one from a batch which has been certified under authority of the federal act.

                <p>(A) In order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and ensure compliance with this article, the Commissioner shall by rule or regulation establish requirements for regular testing of samples or specimens of foods and ingredients by food processing plants for the presence of poisonous or deleterious substances or other contaminants rendering such foods or ingredients injurious to health. Such rules or regulations shall identify the specific classes or types of food processing plants, foods, ingredients, and poisonous or deleterious substances or other contaminants that shall be subject to such testing requirements and the frequency with which such tests shall be performed by food processing plants.
(B)  The Commissioner shall also promulgate rules and regulations establishing minimum standards and requirements for a written food safety plan, such as a hazard analysis critical control point plan, that may be submitted by an operator of a food processing plant to document and describe the procedures used at such plant to prevent the presence of hazards such as poisonous or deleterious substances or other contaminants that would render finished foods or finished ingredients as manufactured at such plant injurious to health, including preventive controls, monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of such controls, and records of corrective actions, including actions taken in response to the presence of known hazards. If an operator of a food processing plant, in its discretion, submits to the department a written food safety plan for such plant and such plan conforms to rules and regulations promulgated for purposes of this subparagraph, then such food processing plant shall comply with the requirements of such written food safety plan, including, but not limited to, any test regimen provided by such plan, in lieu of complying with a test regimen established by rules or regulations promulgated by the Commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.(C</p>

In addition to such civil penalty, within 30 days of the determination by the Commissioner that such violation has occurred, such food processing plant shall submit to the Commissioner a written plan pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.

(iii)  For purposes of this subsection, each day a violation continues after the period established for compliance by the Commissioner shall be considered a separate violation.(iv)  When a civil penalty is imposed under this subsection, such penalty shall be subject to review in the manner prescribed by Article 1 of Chapter 13 of Title 50, known as the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act."</p>

If an article is alleged to be misbranded because the labeling is misleading or if an advertisement is alleged to be false because it is misleading, then, in determining whether the labeling or advertisement is misleading, there shall be taken into account, among other things, not only representations made or suggested by statements, words, designs, devices, sound, or any combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or advertisement fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations or material with respect to consequences which may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or advertisement relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling or advertisement thereof or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.

            <p>§ 26-2-150. Legislative intent
The General Assembly declares that purchasers and consumers have a right to expect and demand honesty and fair practices in the sale of meat for human consumption. It is the purpose of this Code section and Code Sections 26-2-151 through 26-2-154 to ensure that honest, fair, and ethical practices are followed in the advertising and sale of meat for human consumption and to authorize the Commissioner of Agriculture to take all actions necessary to ensure that such practices are followed. The General Assembly views with alarm the fact that misleading and false advertising and sales tactics have been used in the sale of meat to Georgia consumers. It is to stop these practices that the General Assembly has enacted this Code section and Code Sections 26-2-151 through 26-2-154. The consumer has a right to know what he is buying and the true cost of the meat which he is purchasing for consumption.

To assure the protection of the consuming public, no person shall operate a meat processing plant in this state without having first obtained a permanent license from the Commissioner; provided, however, that any meat processing plant operating under a federal grant of inspection from the United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety Inspection Service, shall be exempt from such license requirement. There shall be no fee for such license. The license shall be kept on file in each place of business. The license shall not be transferable. The Georgia Department of Agriculture may refuse to grant inspection, and any such license may be revoked or suspended by the Commissioner for the violation of this article or rules and regulations or sanitary standards and specifications adopted pursuant to this article. The Commissioner shall notify the licensee of the reasons why he or she intends to revoke or suspend the license, and the licensee shall be entitled to a hearing before the Commissioner within ten days after receipt of such notice of intention to revoke or suspend. At such hearing the Commissioner shall consider the circumstances and shall give the licensee reasonable time to correct the conditions or circumstances that caused the notice of intention to revoke or suspend the license to be given.

          <content>
            <p>§ 26-2-241. Testing of milk, cream, or other dairy products
In determining the value of milk, cream, or other dairy products by the use of the Babcock test, it shall be unlawful to give any false reading or in any way manipulate the test so as to give a higher or lower percent of butterfat than the milk, cream, or other dairy products actually contain, or to cause any inaccuracy in reading the percent of butterfat by securing from any quantity of milk, cream, or other dairy products to be tested an inaccurate sample for the test. None other than the Babcock method, or such method of testing as may be approved by the Commissioner, may be employed when testing milk or cream, the test of which is to be used as a basis for making payment for the milk or cream thus tested. None other than the torsion balanced scales, or such scales as may be approved by the Commissioner, may be used when weighing cream for testing, when the tests are to be used as a basis for making payment for cream. It shall be unlawful to use adjustable scale weights in determining the weight of cream used in the Babcock test. Only such centrifuge shall be used as shall meet the approval of the Commissioner. Specifications for apparatus and chemicals and directions for testing milk and cream must conform to Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products, with such additions as shall be deemed advisable by the Commissioner to make them conform to this article. All test tubes, bottles, pipettes, burettes, or instruments used in connection with testing or determining the value of milk, cream, or other dairy products by the use of the Babcock test must be United States government standard and shall be approved by the Commissioner. All milk and cream tests shall be maintained at a temperature of 135 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three minutes before the reading of the percent of butterfat shall be made and recorded. In reading cream tests, glymol or its equivalent must be used, and the samples under test must be held for three minutes in a water bath extending up as high on the graduated neck as the sample itself does.

            <p>§ 26-2-248. Injunctions
Any person, firm, or corporation subject to this article and the other milk laws of this state who violates any of said provisions or any valid rules and regulations made thereunder may be enjoined from such continued violation. The Commissioner is authorized to apply for, and for cause shown the superior court having jurisdiction of the defendant in any such action may grant, injunctive relief, by interlocutory injunction, permanent injunction, or temporary restraining order, as the circumstances may warrant. The proceeding may be maintained notwithstanding the pendency of any civil action and notwithstanding the pendency of or conviction in a criminal proceeding arising from the same transaction. Such action may be maintained without bond. The purpose of this Code section is to create a statutory cause of action by way of injunction, and the Commissioner is authorized to bring such proceedings in the same form and manner and in the same court as other equitable proceedings may be brought. This remedy is not exclusive but is cumulative of other remedies afforded to protect the consuming public from unwholesome products which are economic frauds.

            <p>§ 26-2-294. ExemptionsThe terms of this article shall not apply to:
(1)  Flour, corn meal, or grits sold to bakers or other commercial secondary processors if, prior to or simultaneously with delivery, the purchaser furnishes to the seller a certificate of intent in such form as the Commissioner shall by regulation prescribe, certifying that such flour, corn meal, or grits shall be used only in the production of flour, bread, corn meal, or grits enriched within the given establishment to meet the requirements of this article or shall be used in the manufacture of products other than those covered by this article. It shall be unlawful for any such purchaser so furnishing any such certificate of intent to use the unenriched flour, corn meal, or grits so purchased in any manner other than as stated in the certificate;

(2)  Flour or bread which is made from the entire wheat berry with no parts of the wheat removed from the mixture. In cases of flour or bread containing mixtures of the whole wheat berry and white flour or mixture of various portions of the wheat berry, such products shall have a vitamin and mineral potency at least equal to enriched flour or enriched bread as described herein;

(3)  Corn meal or grits which is made from the entire corn with no parts of the corn removed from the mixture, but shall not be construed to prevent the enrichment of such products if so desired by the manufacturer. Any products so enriched must conform to standards and labeling provisions as provided in this article as modified by the Commissioner;

(4)  Flour, corn meal, or grits for the wheat and corn producer whereby the miller is paid in wheat or corn or feed for the grinding service rendered, except in so far as such a mill may produce flour or degerminated corn meal or grits and sell or offer for sale such products, whereupon this article shall be applicable; nor shall this article apply to farmers in exchanging their corn for corn meal and wheat for flour, or having the same ground into flour, corn meal, or grits and disposing of the same for their own use or the use of the farm labor on their farms; or

(5)  Mills doing custom grinding of wheat, whose capacity is 20 bushels of wheat per hour or less, and for custom mills that do not use artificial methods for bleaching flour.

            <p>§ 26-3-7. When a drug or device deemed adulteratedA drug or device shall be deemed to be adulterated:(1)  (A) If it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance;
(B)  If it has been produced, prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health;

(C)  If it is a drug and its container is composed in whole or in part of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; or

(D)  If it is a drug and it bears or contains for purposes of coloring only a coal-tar color other than one from a batch certified under the authority of the federal act;

(2)  If it purports to be or is represented as a drug the name of which is recognized in an official compendium and its strength differs from or its quality or purity falls below the standard set forth in such compendium. Such determination as to strength, quality, or purity shall be made in accordance with the tests or methods of assay set forth in such compendium or, in the absence of or inadequacy of such tests or methods of assay, those prescribed under authority of the federal act. No drug defined in an official compendium shall be deemed to be adulterated under this paragraph because it differs from the standard of strength, quality, or purity therefor set forth in such compendium if its difference in strength, quality, or purity from such standard is plainly stated on its label. Whenever a drug is recognized in both the United States Pharmacopoeia and the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, it shall be subject to the requirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homeopathic drug, in which case it shall be subject to the provisions of the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to those of the United States Pharmacopoeia;

(3)  If it is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Code section and its strength differs from or its purity or quality falls below that which it purports or is represented to possess; or(4)  If it is a drug and any substance has been:
(A)  Mixed or packed therewith so as to reduce its quality or strength; or

(B)  Substituted wholly or in part therefor.

                <p>(A) The regulation of other employees in the prescription or pharmacy department, including but not limited to the registration and regulation of pharmacy technicians. The board shall be required to establish the minimum qualifications for the registration of pharmacy technicians and shall be authorized to require the completion of a background check and criminal history record check for each person applying for registration as a pharmacy technician in this state. The certificate of registration, once issued, may be valid for no more than two years and shall be renewable biennially upon payment of a renewal fee and compliance with such other conditions as the board may establish by rule or regulation. The board shall be authorized to deny registration, to deny renewal, or to revoke or suspend the registration of a pharmacy technician for any of the grounds set forth in Code Section 26-4-60 or Code Section 43-1-19. However, said denial of a technician application, denial of the renewal of a certificate, or suspension or revocation of a technician registration shall not be considered a contested case under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," but said applicant or registrant shall be entitled to an appearance before the board. The board shall be required to establish and maintain a registry of pharmacy technicians in this state which contains the name and home address of each pharmacy technician and his or her employer and location of employment. The board shall establish a process by which the pharmacist in charge of each pharmacy shall provide updated information on the pharmacy technicians in the pharmacy. The board may establish and collect fees from pharmacy technicians, their employers, or both for the registration of pharmacy technicians and maintenance of the registry.(B)</p>

              <p>In enforcing this paragraph, the board may, upon reasonable grounds, require a registrant or applicant to submit to a mental or physical examination by licensed health care providers designated by the board. The results of such examination shall be admissible in any hearing before the board, notwithstanding any claim of privilege under a contrary rule of law or statute, including, but not limited to, Code Section 24-9-21. Every person who shall accept the privilege of practicing as a pharmacy technician in this state or who shall file an application for a certificate of registration to practice pharmacy in this state shall be deemed to have given his or her consent to submit to such mental or physical examination and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the results in any hearing before the board, upon the grounds that the same constitutes a privileged communication. If a registrant or applicant fails to submit to such an examination when properly directed to do so by the board, unless such failure was due to circumstances beyond his or her control, the board may enter a final order upon proper notice, hearing, and proof of such refusal. Any registrant or applicant who is prohibited from practicing as a pharmacy technician under this paragraph shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the board that he or she can resume or begin practicing as a pharmacy technician with reasonable skill and safety to patients.

(ii)  For the purposes of this paragraph, the board may, upon reasonable grounds, obtain any and all records relating to the mental or physical condition of a registrant or applicant, including psychiatric records; and such records shall be admissible in any hearing before the board, notwithstanding any claim of privilege under a contrary rule of law or statute, including, but not limited to, Code Section 24-9-21.

This restriction shall also prohibit a private, nongovernment affiliated organization from examining or copying continuing education certificates maintained by individual registrants. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit the pharmacist in charge from voluntarily allowing appropriate agencies and organizations to inspect or examine the records and pharmacy area under the control of the pharmacist in charge provided such inspections or examinations are for the purposes of ensuring the quality of care provided to patients;</p>

(A)  For any order issued in resolution of a disciplinary proceeding before the board, the board may direct any licensee found guilty of a charge involving a violation of any drug laws or rules to pay to the board a sum not to exceed the reasonable costs of the investigation and prosecution of the case and, in any case, not to exceed $25,000.00. The costs to be assessed shall be fixed by the board and the costs so recovered shall be paid to the state treasury; and(B)  In the case of a pharmacy or wholesale distributor, the order issued may be made to the corporate owner, if any, and to any pharmacist, officer, owner, or partner of the pharmacy or wholesale distributor who is found to have had knowledge of or have participated knowingly in one or more of the violations set forth in this Code section.
Where an order for recovery of costs is made and timely payment is not made as directed in the board's decision, the board may enforce the order for payment in the court in the county where the administrative hearing was held. This right of enforcement shall be in addition to any other rights the board may have as to any person directed to pay costs. In any action for recovery of costs, proof of the board's decision shall be conclusive proof of the validity of the order of payment and the terms for payment.

            <p>§ 26-4-45. Continuing professional pharmaceutical education requirements
The board shall establish a program of continuing professional pharmaceutical education for the renewal of pharmacist licenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no pharmacist license shall be renewed by the board or the executive director until the pharmacist submits to the board satisfactory proof of his or her participation, during the biennium preceding his or her application for renewal, in a minimum of 30 hours of approved programs of continuing professional pharmacy education as defined in this Code section. Continuing professional pharmacy education shall consist of educational programs providing training pertinent to the practice of pharmacy and approved by the board under this Code section. The board shall approve educational programs for persons practicing pharmacy in this state on a reasonable nondiscriminatory fee basis and may contract with institutions of higher learning, professional organizations, or qualified individuals for the providing of approved programs. In addition to such programs, the board shall allow the continuing professional pharmacy education requirement to be fulfilled by the completion of approved correspondence courses which provide the required hours of approved programs of continuing professional pharmaceutical education or to be fulfilled by a combination of approved correspondence courses and other approved educational programs. The board may, consistent with the requirements of this Code section, promulgate rules and regulations to implement and administer this Code section, including the establishment of a committee to prescribe standards, approve and contract for educational programs, and set the required minimum number of hours per year.

              <p>In regards to pharmacists compounding nonpatient-specific sterile drugs to be provided to practitioners to use in patient care or altering or repackaging such drugs for practitioners to use in patient care in the practitioner's office, such nonpatient-specific sterile compounding shall only be conducted by an outsourcing facility and as allowed by applicable federal law and board rule for pharmaceutical compounding using USP-NF standards for sterile compounding. Such sterile drugs may be compounded only in quantities determined by board rule following consultation with the Georgia Composite Medical Board. No Schedule II, III, IV, or V controlled substance, as defined in Article 2 of Chapter 13 of Title 16, shall be eligible for such designation. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to apply to pharmacies owned or operated by institutions or to pharmacists or practitioners within or employed by an institution or affiliated entity; provided, however, that pharmacies owned or operated by institutions and pharmacists and practitioners within or employed by institutions or affiliated entities shall remain subject to other requirements, rules, and regulations established by the board and the federal Food and Drug Administration governing the compounding of medication.</p>

            <p>§ 26-4-141. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds that certain practices are unfair to providers of pharmaceuticals, are burdensome and costly to those providers, result in unfair increased costs to certain consumers, and threaten the availability of pharmaceuticals to the public. The General Assembly further finds that there is a need for regulation of certain practices engaged in by some third-party prescription program administrators.

Based on the results of the study, the board shall establish a mandated implementation date for electronic pedigrees which shall be no sooner than December 31, 2011, and may be extended by the board in one year increments if it appears the technology is not universally available across the entire prescription pharmaceutical supply; provided, however, that no provision of this article shall be effective until such time as the General Assembly appropriates reasonable funds for administration of this subsection. Effective at a date established by the board, pedigrees may be implemented through an approved and readily available system based on electronic track and trace pedigree technology. This electronic tracking system will be deemed to be readily available for use on a wide scale across the entire pharmaceutical supply chain which includes manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and pharmacies. Consideration must be given to the large-scale implementation of this technology across the supply chain and the technology must be proven to have no negative impact on the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product.</p>
