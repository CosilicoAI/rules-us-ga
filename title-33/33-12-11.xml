          <p>Whenever any loss insured against shall occur, the insured or other person entitled to the proceeds of the policy, by judgment or otherwise, in order to secure his recovery, may give notice to the Commissioner of the occurrence of said loss and of the amount claimed, after which notice the Commissioner shall be bound to retain, subject to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction trying any action that may be brought for the recovery of the loss or any action which may be brought upon any judgment obtained in the courts of another state or the courts of the United States on account of the loss, a sufficient amount to pay the judgment in said case in event of recovery; and, if the amount for which the depositing insurer is liable shall not be paid within 30 days, said plaintiff may file an application with the judge of the superior court of the county where the case was tried for appointment of the Commissioner as receiver to take charge of as many securities as shall be necessary to satisfy the aforesaid judgment.</p>
