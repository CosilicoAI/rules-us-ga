          <p>All domestic stock and mutual insurance corporations, whether they expire by their own limitation or are otherwise dissolved, shall nevertheless be continued for a term of three years from such expiration or dissolution, except in any dissolution under Chapter 37 of this title, as bodies corporate for the purpose of prosecuting and defending actions by or against them and of enabling them to settle and close their business, to dispose of and convey their property, and to divide their assets among those entitled to such assets, but not for the purpose of continuing business as insurers; provided, however, that as to any action or proceeding commenced by or against the corporation prior to such expiration or dissolution and with respect to any action or proceeding commenced by or against the corporation within three years after the date of the expiration or dissolution, the corporation shall for the purpose of the actions or proceedings only be continued as bodies corporate beyond the three-year period and until any judgments, orders, or decrees in the expiration or dissolution actions or proceedings are fully executed.</p>
