The owner of a vessel shall be liable for any injury or damage occasioned by the negligent operation of the vessel, whether the negligence consists of a violation of the statutes of this state or of neglecting to observe such ordinary care in such operation as the rules of common law require. The owner shall not be liable, however, unless the vessel is being used with his or her express or implied consent. It shall be presumed that the vessel is being operated with the knowledge and consent of the owner if, at the time of the injury or damage, the vessel is under the control of his or her spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, or other immediate member of the owner's family. Nothing contained in this Code section shall be construed to relieve any other person from any liability which he would otherwise have nor shall anything contained in this Code section be construed to authorize or permit any recovery in excess of injury or damage actually incurred.

              <p>The General Assembly finds and declares that every community in Georgia is impacted by the marketing and distribution of illegal drugs. The purpose of this Code section is to provide a civil remedy for damages to persons in a community injured as a result of illegal drug use. Those persons include parents, employers, insurers, governmental entities, and others who pay for drug treatments, as well as infants injured as a result of exposure to drugs in utero. This Code section will enable them to recover from those persons in the community who have joined the illegal drug market. A further purpose of this Code section is to shift, to the extent possible, the cost of the damage caused by the existence of the illegal drug market in a community to those who illegally profit from that market. Another purpose of this Code section is to establish the prospect of substantial monetary loss as a deterrent to those who have not yet entered into the illegal drug distribution market.</p>

            <p>§ 51-11-1. Authorization to act as justification; effect of plea
If the defendant in a tort action was authorized to do the act complained of, he may plead such authorization as justification. The effect of such plea is to admit that the act was done and to entitle the defendant to all the privileges of one holding the affirmative of the issue. Such plea, however, shall not give the defendant the right to open and conclude the argument before the jury unless it is filed before the plaintiff submits any evidence to the jury.

(1)  A land surveyor possessing a certificate of registration issued by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors has surveyed the property from which the timber is to be harvested and plainly established and clearly marked the metes and bounds of the property such that a reasonable person would know or should have known of the existence of such markings when harvesting the timber and has provided a copy of that survey to the third-party timber harvester;

(2)  The boundaries of the property from which timber is sold have been completely and accurately indicated using physical markers that are clearly visible such that a reasonable person would know or should have known of the existence of such physical markers; or

(3)  The property owner has obtained a document indicating where the boundaries are and signed by adjoining landowners indicating that they agree on the location of such boundaries and has provided a copy of such document to the third-party timber harvester; provided, however, that such document shall only create a presumption in favor of the property owner with regard to those landowners who have signed such document.

                <p>However, any attempt to satisfy the public offense or to suppress a prosecution therefor is illegal and will vitiate the entire agreement, except in those cases for which the law expressly allows such a settlement. Such an attempt to satisfy or to suppress prosecution of a public offense which amounts to a felony is itself an offense under this Code; and, even if executed, an agreement to this effect shall be no defense to an action for the tort. If the offense does not amount to a felony and the agreement is fully executed, such agreement shall constitute satisfaction for the private tort.

            <p>§ 51-11-21. Tender of damages in tort action; effect of continuing tender
A person committing a tort may, before or after an action is brought, tender to the person injured such an amount of damages as in his judgment will cover the injury; and, if the same shall be rejected, he may deposit the amount in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county of his residence as a continuing tender; and, if the jury trying the cause shall give no more damages than the amount tendered, the plaintiff shall recover no costs accruing subsequently to the time of the tender.

The trier of fact, in its discretion, may consider such available benefits or payments and the cost thereof but shall not be directed to reduce an award of damages accordingly.

Damages are given as compensation for injury; generally, such compensation is the measure of damages where an injury is of a character capable of being estimated in money. If an injury is small or the mitigating circumstances are strong, nominal damages only are given.

            <p>§ 51-12-6. Damages for injury to peace, happiness, or feelings
In a tort action in which the entire injury is to the peace, happiness, or feelings of the plaintiff, no measure of damages can be prescribed except the enlightened consciences of impartial jurors. In such an action, punitive damages under Code Section 51-12-5 or Code Section 51-12-5.1 shall not be awarded.

If the damage incurred by the plaintiff is only the imaginary or possible result of a tortious act or if other and contingent circumstances preponderate in causing the injury, such damage is too remote to be the basis of recovery against the wrongdoer.

Damages which are the legal and natural result of the act done, though contingent to some extent, are not too remote to be recovered. However, damages traceable to the act, but which are not its legal and natural consequence, are too remote and contingent to be recovered.

When a tort is committed, a contract is broken, or a duty is omitted with knowledge and for the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of certain contemplated benefits, the remote damages occasioned thereby become a proper subject for the consideration of the jury.

Defendant's opposition shall be filed with the trial court and served on plaintiff's counsel and each defendant.

(C)  If the defendant does not file an opposition challenging plaintiff's prima-facie evidence of physical impairment within the time permitted, the trial court shall determine if the plaintiff has established prima-facie evidence of physical impairment based on the papers and documentation submitted to the trial court. The trial court's decision shall be made in a timely manner.

(D)  If the defendant files an objection, the plaintiff may file a reply with the trial court within ten days of service of defendant's opposition. The reply must be served on each defendant.

(E)  The trial court shall determine if the plaintiff has established prima-facie evidence of physical impairment with respect to an asbestos claim or silica claim in a timely manner based on the papers and documentation submitted to the trial court. A hearing will be conducted only if the trial court so orders on its own motion, or if, in the exercise of discretion, the trial court grants a party's request for a hearing. No testimony shall be taken at the hearing. A decision of the trial court not to grant a request for a hearing may not be appealed and does not constitute reversible error. If the trial court determines that the plaintiff has failed to establish prima-facie evidence of physical impairment, it shall dismiss the plaintiff's complaint without prejudice.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an asbestos claim or silica claim that meets the requirements of this chapter permitting a claim to be filed in this state may only be filed in the county where the plaintiff resides or a county in which the exposure to asbestos or silica on which the claim is based occurred. If a plaintiff alleges that an exposed person was exposed to asbestos or silica while located in more than one county, the trial court shall determine which of the counties is the most appropriate forum for the claim, considering the relative amounts and lengths of the exposed person's exposure to asbestos or silica in each of those counties.

            <p>§ 51-14-13. Severability
In the event any part, portion, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this chapter shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other parts, portions, sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words of this chapter which shall remain of full force and effect as if the part, portion, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. For example, if a court determines that a particular word renders any portion or application of this chapter unconstitutional, in that event, the court shall strike that word and apply this chapter as if it were enacted without that word. The General Assembly declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this chapter if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. The General Assembly does not intend for this chapter to make any substantive change in the law governing claims that accrued before April 12, 2005, and has only included procedural provisions that govern where such claims can be filed and what early reports must be filed in such cases. This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with the General Assembly's intention not to make any substantive changes in the law applicable to cases that accrued before April 12, 2005. The General Assembly expressly declares its intent that Code Section 51-14-9 remain in full force and effect if any other part or parts of this chapter shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. The General Assembly further expressly declares its intent that, in the event any part, portion, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this chapter shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional as applied to asbestos claims or silica claims that accrued before April 12, 2005, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the applicability of any part, portion, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this chapter to asbestos claims or silica claims that accrued or may accrue on or after May 1, 2007.

            <p>§ 51-15-1. Legislative findings; limitations on liabilities
The General Assembly finds that the number of asbestos related claims has increased significantly in recent years and threatens the continued viability of a number of uniquely situated companies that have not ever manufactured, sold, or distributed asbestos or asbestos products and are argued to be liable only as successor corporations. This liability has created an overpowering public necessity to provide an immediate, clarifying, and remedial legislative solution. The General Assembly intends that the cumulative recovery by all asbestos claimants from innocent successors be limited, and intends to simply clarify and fix the form of asbestos claimants' remedies without impairing their substantive rights and finds that there are no alternative means to meet this public necessity. The General Assembly finds that Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Mississippi, Florida, and South Carolina have enacted legislation similar to this chapter that, among other things, provides limitations of liabilities for asbestos claims for innocent successors. The General Assembly finds the public interest as a whole is best served by providing relief to these innocent successors so that they may remain viable and continue to contribute to this state. The General Assembly further finds that Georgia's successor liability statutes were never intended or contemplated to impose liability on successors in the situation covered by this chapter.

          <content>
            <p>§ 51-7-21. Effect of good faith on liability for imprisonment under warrant

In such cases, good faith must be determined from the circumstances. A judicial officer issuing a warrant in good faith shall not be liable for false imprisonment, provided that, when he has no jurisdiction, there shall be a presumption against such officer's good faith.

            <p>§ 51-9-6. Damages for continuing trespass

            <p>§ 51-9-7. Diversion, obstruction, or pollution of stream as trespass
The owner of land through which nonnavigable watercourses flow is entitled to have the water in such streams come to his land in its natural and usual flow, subject only to such detention or diminution as may be caused by a reasonable use of it by other riparian proprietors. The diverting of the stream in whole or in part from its natural and usual flow, or the obstructing thereof so as to impede its course or cause it to overflow or injure the land through which it flows or any right appurtenant thereto, or the polluting thereof so as to lessen its value to the owner of such land shall constitute a trespass upon the property.

The course of a stream of water underground and its exact condition before its first use are so difficult of ascertainment that trespass may not be brought for any supposed interference with the rights of a proprietor.
