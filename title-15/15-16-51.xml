          <p>It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any sheriff's office or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the sheriff's office or a member thereof. Furthermore, the sheriff's office, which has provided quality law enforcement services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the sheriff's office, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any sheriff office's name or any term used to identify the sheriff's office or its members without the express permission of the sheriff. The provisions of this article are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.</p>
