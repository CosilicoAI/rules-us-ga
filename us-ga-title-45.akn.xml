          <content>
            <p>§ 45-10-1. Code of ethics for government service generally -- Establishment and textThere is established for and within the state and for and in all governments therein a code of ethics for government service which shall read as follows:
CODE OF ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE      Any person in government service should:
I.  Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or government department.

II.  Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.

III.  Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay and give to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.

IV.  Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.

V.  Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not, and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.

VI.  Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.

VII.  Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties.

VIII.  Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.

IX.  Expose corruption wherever discovered.

X.  Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

The person so designated to perform the duties of the Commissioner of Insurance shall give bond with good security in the penal sum of $5,000.00, payable, conditioned, and to be approved in the same manner as the bond required by law to be given by the Commissioner of Insurance. The person designated to perform the duties of the Commissioner of Insurance shall not receive any compensation in addition to that he was, or is, receiving as clerk, but any expense incurred in furnishing the bond required by this Code section and Code Section 45-12-24 shall be borne by the state.

            <p>§ 45-12-191. Legislative intent and purpose of articleIt is the purpose of this article to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a Governor and the inauguration of a new Governor. The interest of the state requires that such transitions in the office of Governor be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the conduct of the affairs of the state government. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the state and its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in this article directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the General Assembly that all officers of the state government conduct the affairs of the state government for which they exercise responsibility and authority so as to:
(1)  Be mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of Governor;

(2)  Take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power; and

(3)  Otherwise promote orderly transitions in the office of Governor.

            <p>§ 45-15-30. Created; assistants, deputies, and other personnel; determination of duties, salaries, and promotions; limitation on private practice of law; disclosure requirement for assistant attorney general representing criminal defendant
There is created a Department of Law with the Attorney General at the head thereof and with such numbers of deputy attorneys general, assistant attorneys general, special assistant attorneys general, other attorneys, paraprofessional personnel, and other employees or independent contractors as the Attorney General shall deem necessary to carry out the functions of the Attorney General and the Department of Law. The Attorney General is authorized to determine the title and to change the title of any attorney or other employee of the Department of Law or any attorney at law under independent contract to the Department of Law in order to define the duties and responsibilities of any attorney or other employee of the said department and to establish salaries and effect promotions of any such attorney or other employee of the said department, except that those positions in the department which are within the classified service on April 18, 1975, shall be covered by the procedures prescribed by the State Personnel Board. Neither the Attorney General nor any other attorney at law employed full time by the Department of Law shall engage in the private practice of law during his or her term of appointment. Attorneys at law under independent contract to the Department of Law may engage in the private practice of law even though they may have been appointed or designated either specially or generally as assistant attorneys general or attorneys. Notwithstanding that any attorney at law under independent contract to the Department of Law has been appointed or designated either specially or generally as an assistant attorney general and thus is identified with the State of Georgia as its representative for cases arising within the scope of that appointment or designation, representation of a defendant in criminal proceedings by that assistant attorney general shall not constitute a conflict of interest if that assistant attorney general provides written disclosure of such appointment or designation to the defendant prior to accepting employment by that defendant or, when a court has appointed an assistant attorney general to represent an indigent criminal defendant, disclosures to the defendant and to the court, to be reflected in the record of that court, such appointment or designation as assistant attorney general.

            <p>§ 45-16-6. Participation in training course
During every calendar year they are in office, every coroner and deputy coroner shall be required, as a condition of continuing to serve as coroner, to take a training course approved by the Georgia Coroner's Training Council pursuant to Code Section 45-16-66.  Any coroner or deputy coroner taking the approved training course provided by the Georgia Police Academy shall receive the same expense allowance per day as that received by a member of the General Assembly, plus reimbursement of actual transportation costs while traveling by public carrier or the legal mileage rate for the use of a personal automobile and registration fees for such training course.  Such expense allowance and reimbursements shall be paid by the county governing authority from county funds.  In the event, however, that a coroner or deputy is prevented in any calendar year from taking such training by sickness or other providential cause, the requirement of training for that year may be waived by the Georgia Coroner's Training Council.

Each deputy coroner shall serve at the pleasure of the coroner and may be replaced by the coroner at any time. Each deputy coroner shall take the same oath, give the same bond, be entitled to the same fees, and have the same powers as the coroner; but a deputy coroner shall act as coroner only when the coroner is himself unable to act.</p>

            <p>§ 45-16-8. Service of process when sheriff disqualified
If any person makes an affidavit stating (1) that a sheriff is disqualified from acting in any proceeding, which disqualification was not apparent at the outset of the proceeding, or (2) that a sheriff or his deputy refuses to serve a writ or other process, then the clerk of the court from which the process issues shall place the process in the hands of the coroner for execution. The clerk may compel the sheriff to return the writ or other process to the clerk's office in order to allow for execution by the coroner.

In addition to the minimum salary provided for in Code Section 45-16-11, in any county which is the site of more than one state correctional institution or prison for adults or juveniles and which compensates the county coroner by salary, the state shall compensate the county coroner in the amount of $110.00 for each state inmate death in such county. The county coroner of such a county is authorized to accept the compensation provided in accordance with this Code section despite any local Act which requires such a coroner to send fees to the county treasury or the county governing authority.

The medical examiner, at any time, to facilitate examination, when he or she deems it necessary, may have the body embalmed or retain it for refrigeration for preservation or to avoid the threat of infectious disease prior to release of the body to the next of kin.

(A)  When upon the completion of the medical examiner's inquiry the peace officer in charge and the medical examiner are satisfied that, even though death resulted from violence, no foul play was involved. In this event, the peace officer in charge and the medical examiner shall make a written report of their investigation and findings to the division as set forth in Code Section 45-16-32, and upon their recommendation, the coroner shall make and file a proper death certificate;

(B)  When there is sufficient evidence to establish the cause and manner of death, even though the medical examiner's inquiry revealed that death resulted from foul play;

(C)  When no demand for an inquest is made within 30 days after the filing of the death certificate. However, if such demand is made by the party or parties affected by the death, the coroner shall be authorized to hold the inquest;

(D)  When upon the completion of the medical examiner's inquiry the medical examiner and peace officer in charge are sufficiently satisfied that death resulted from natural causes, and that medical examiner or coroner is willing to and does sign and file a proper death certificate, and no demand for an inquest is made within 30 days thereafter;

Any books, records, or papers received by the coroner, medical examiner, or medical examiner from the office of chief medical examiner pursuant to the subpoena must be regarded as confidential information and privileged and not subject to disclosure under Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50. The actual costs of copying any books, records, or papers for the purposes of responding to a subpoena under this subsection shall be paid out of county funds to the person or entity required to respond to that subpoena, and the governing authority of the county of which that coroner or county medical examiner is a public officer shall pay those costs within 30 days after a bill therefor is submitted to the county. A medical examiner from the office of chief medical examiner shall pay the costs of copying from state funds within 30 days after a bill therefor is submitted to the state.</p>

In the case of death of any person under such circumstances as would not require a medical examiner's inquiry under Code Section 45-16-24, any physician who is duly licensed under the laws of this state or any other state having licensing requirements equal to or greater than those imposed by this state shall be deemed to have been legally authorized to perform an autopsy upon the body of a deceased person when such autopsy has been consented to by the person assuming custody of the body for the purposes of burial, such as the husband, wife, father, mother, child, guardian, next of kin, or, in the absence of any of the foregoing, a friend of such deceased person charged by law with the responsibility of burial. If two or more of such persons assume custody of the body, the consent of one of them shall be deemed sufficient legal authorization for the performance of the autopsy.

            <p>§ 45-16-31. Authorization of removal of body for convenience of examination; investigation of premises before removal
When the deceased body lies in a place inconvenient for holding a medical examiner's inquiry, the medical examiner or coroner shall be allowed to remove the body to the autopsy room of the nearest public hospital or morgue. If neither the coroner nor the medical examiner is immediately available, the peace officer may assume the authority to have the body moved to such facility. When such facility is not reasonably available, the body may be removed to such other suitable place as may be designated by the coroner or the medical examiner or by the peace officer in charge in the absence of the coroner or medical examiner.  If the peace officer in charge is present, no such body shall be removed until photographs of the body and surrounding premises have been made and a thorough investigation of the premises has been made by the proper investigating authorities.

The medical examiner and coroner shall complete a report of each medical examiner's inquiry and coroner's investigation and shall maintain permanent records of such reports. The coroner or county medical examiner may file all original reports with the clerk of the superior court of the county.

When any person has been admitted to a hospital or morgue as a result of any casualty and for any reason whatsoever is unable to give his or her consent to the taking of a sample of blood for analytical purposes, the coroner or peace officer in charge of the investigation of the circumstances surrounding the casualty may notify a medical examiner for the purpose of obtaining a blood sample to test for the presence of intoxicating substances or in the case of a dead body and where appropriate for the presence of infectious agents. The blood may be drawn by the medical examiner or at the medical examiner's direction. The medical examiner or his or her designee shall be entitled to a fee set in accordance with Code Section 35-3-151 for performing these services, which fee shall be paid in the same manner as set out in Code Section 45-16-22. The peace officer may also request any licensed physician, nurse, emergency medical technician, medical or laboratory technician, or other qualified person to withdraw blood for purposes of this Code section, in which event such person shall incur no civil or criminal liability. The medical examiner or the peace officer in charge shall submit the blood specimens to the division for analysis; and a report shall be submitted by the division to the submitting officer.

            <p>§ 45-17-4. Fees; Secretary of State to keep record of notaries appointed; reappointment
Before a certificate shall be issued to a notary public, he or she shall pay to the clerk of the superior court the sum prescribed by Code Section 15-6-77, relating to fees of clerks of the superior courts, from which amount the clerk shall be entitled to cover his or her services in issuing the certificate of appointment as notary public, administering the oath, and recording the same. The amount by which the sum prescribed by Code Section 15-6-77 exceeds the amount which the clerk is required by this Code section to forward to the Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority is what the clerk shall use to cover his or her services. The clerk shall immediately send a copy of the certificate of appointment, under his or her seal of office, and $2.00 to the Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority which shall keep a record showing the names of the notaries public appointed with their addresses, signatures, ages, sex, and the terms for which their commissions run; and such amount shall cover the cost of the Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority in keeping such records. On reappointment as notaries public, the sum prescribed by Code Section 15-6-77 shall be paid to the clerk of the superior court and disbursed in the same manner as the fee for the original appointment is disbursed under this Code section.

              <p>The council is authorized to establish a flexible employee benefit plan for employees of the state and public schoolteachers and public school employees and to promulgate rules and regulations for its administration, subject to the limitations contained in this article and in Articles 1 and 2 of this chapter. The flexible employee benefit plan may provide for deductions or salary reductions for group life insurance, group property and casualty insurance, disability insurance, supplemental health and accident insurance, health care or dependent care spending accounts as authorized under Section 125 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, other types of employee welfare benefits, or for salary reductions for health premiums under Article 1 of this chapter and Code Sections 20-2-880 and 20-2-910. The council may establish rating categories for disability insurance based on eligibility for coverage by the disability program of the Social Security Administration.  At the council's discretion, any of the insurance or other type of employee welfare benefits authorized by this Code section may be operated as a self-insured plan in whole or in part or by contract with any company authorized to transact such business in this state. Except as provided in Code Section 45-18-30, Code Sections 20-2-880 and 20-2-910, and as implemented prior to January 1, 1986, the council is authorized to establish the plan or plans in connection with plans authorized by the United States Internal Revenue Code for the purpose of income tax advantage.</p>

            <p>§ 45-2-1. Persons ineligible to hold civil office; vacation of office; validity of acts performed while in officeThe following persons are ineligible to hold any civil office; and the existence of any of the following facts shall be a sufficient reason for vacating any office held by such person; but the acts of such person, while holding a commission, shall be valid as the acts of an officer de facto, namely:
(1)  Persons who are not citizens of this state and persons under the age of 21 years; provided, however, that upon passage of appropriate local ordinances, citizens of this state who are otherwise qualified and who have attained 18 years of age shall be eligible to hold any county or municipal office, except such offices of a judicial nature. The residency requirement for a candidate for any county office, except offices of a judicial nature, shall be 12 months' residency within the county. The residency requirement for a candidate for any municipal office, except offices of a judicial nature, shall be 12 months' residency within the municipality; provided, however, that municipalities may by charter provide for lesser residency requirements for candidates for municipal office, except offices of a judicial nature. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, the General Assembly may provide by local law for a period of district residency for candidates for any county or municipal governing authority or board of education who are elected from districts not to exceed 12 months' residency within the district from which each such candidate seeks election. Any local law previously enacted by the General Assembly providing for a period of district residency for candidates for county or municipal office which does not exceed 12 months shall be granted full force and effect;

(2)  All holders or receivers of public money of this state or any county, school district, or municipality thereof who have refused or failed when called upon after reasonable opportunity to account for and pay over the same to the proper officer;

(3)  Any person finally convicted and sentenced for any felony involving moral turpitude under the laws of this or any other state when the offense is also a felony in this state, unless restored to all his rights of citizenship by a pardon from the State Board of Pardons and Paroles;

(4)  Persons holding any office of profit or trust under the government of the United States other than that of postmaster and officers and enlisted men of the reserve components of the armed forces of the United States, or of either of the several states, or of any foreign state; provided, however, that without prejudice to his right to hold public office, any person may accept appointment to, and may receive his expenses and compensation arising from, membership upon any commission, board, panel, or other fact-finding or policy-making agency appointed by the President of the United States or other federal authority, where such appointment is of a temporary nature and the duties are not such as to interfere materially with the person's duties as a public officer. Acceptance of such an appointment and receipt of the emoluments therefrom shall not bar the right of any person to hold office in this state or to accede to a state office;

(5)  Persons of unsound mind and persons who, from advanced age or bodily infirmity, are unfit to discharge the duties of the office to which they are chosen or appointed;

(6)  Those persons who have not been inhabitants of the state, county, district, or circuit for the period required by the Constitution and laws of this state;

(7)  A person who has not been a bona fide citizen of the county in which that person shall be elected or appointed at least 12 months prior to that person's election or appointment and who is not a qualified voter entitled to vote; provided, however, that no prior state or county residency requirement shall be applicable to any appointed local superintendent of schools; or

(8)  All persons who are constitutionally disqualified for any cause. All officers are eligible for reelection and reappointment and to hold other offices, unless expressly declared to the contrary by the Constitution or laws of Georgia.

              <p>It is the purpose of this article to establish in the state a system of personnel administration which will attract, select, and retain the best employees based on merit, free from coercive political influences, with incentives in the form of equal opportunities for all; which will provide technically competent and loyal personnel to render impartial service to the public at all times and to render such service according to the dictates of ethics and morality; and which will remove unnecessary and inefficient employees. It is specifically the intent of the General Assembly to promote this purpose by allowing agencies greater flexibility in personnel management so as to promote the overall effectiveness and efficiency of state government. To this end, and in accordance with Code Sections 45-20-2 and 45-20-6, all positions filled after July 1, 1996, shall be included in the unclassified service as defined in this article, except as provided in Code Section 15-11-69. It is also specifically the intent of the General Assembly that employees in the classified service prior to July 1, 1996, shall continue to be employees in the classified service so long as they remain in classified positions or as otherwise provided by law. It is further specifically the intent of the General Assembly that state government operate within a framework of consistent core personnel policies and practices across all state agencies and entities and that the state's most valued resource, its employees, be managed in a manner to promote work force productivity and sound business practices.</p>

              <p>It is the intent of the General Assembly that employees in the classified service be required to serve a working test period before they obtain rights of appeal and that the successful completion of this probationary period is part of the employment examination procedure. Each employee serving in a working test period shall be provided with management review by the appointing authority within ten calendar days of the date the employee has completed one-half of the working test period or as near to such date as is practicable. The management review shall include an evaluation of the employee's progress and recommendations, if any, for corrective action. The provision of management review pursuant to this subsection is solely for the purpose of promoting efficient management and employee development and shall not be interpreted as granting any additional rights to a working test employee. The State Personnel Board shall be responsible for adopting and amending rules and regulations establishing the guidelines to be used by the appointing authority in completing the management review pursuant to this subsection.

              <p>This article is not intended to create a property interest in the job, but rather to create only a procedure under which classified employees can be dismissed or otherwise adversely affected. The procedure adopted for dismissing a classified employee from employment or otherwise adversely affecting his or her compensation or employment status shall include, as a minimum, that the appointing authority must provide the classified employee with reasons for the action and an opportunity to file an appeal and request a hearing which may be held before either the board or an administrative law judge of the Office of State Administrative Hearings; provided, however, that the hearing may be held subsequent to the effective date of the dismissal or other purported adverse action; provided, further, that the right to appeal shall not apply when persons are dismissed or otherwise adversely affected as to compensation due to curtailment of funds or reduction in staff when such action is in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board.</p>

              <p>Subpoenas shall be issued without discrimination between public and private parties. When a subpoena is disobeyed, any party may apply to the superior court of the county where the hearing is being held for an order requiring obedience. Failure to comply with such order shall be cause for punishment as for contempt of court. The costs of securing the attendance of witnesses, including fees and mileage, shall be computed and assessed in the same manner as prescribed by law in civil cases in the superior court. Once issued a subpoena may be quashed by the board or an administrative law judge if it appears that the subpoena was used primarily as a means of harassment, that the testimony or documents sought are cumulative, that the testimony or documents sought are not relevant, that the testimony or documents sought are not material, that to respond to the subpoena would be unduly burdensome, or that for other good reasons basic fairness dictates that the subpoena should not be enforced.</p>

              <p>An applicant for state employment who is offered employment in a position designated by the head of the agency, department, commission, bureau, board, college, university, institution, or authority as requiring a drug test shall, prior to commencing employment or within ten days after commencing employment, submit to an established test for illegal drugs. All costs of such testing shall be paid from public funds by the employing agency or unit of state government. Any such test which indicates the presence of illegal drugs shall be followed by a confirmatory test using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. If the results of the confirmatory test indicate the presence of illegal drugs, such results shall be reviewed and interpreted by a medical review officer to determine if there is an alternative medical explanation. If the applicant provides appropriate documentation and the medical review officer determines that it was a legitimate usage of the substance, the result shall be reported as negative. Any applicant who fails to provide an alternative medical explanation shall be reported by the medical review officer as having a positive test result. Any applicant offered employment who refuses to submit to an established test for illegal drugs or whose test results are positive shall be disqualified from employment by the state. Such disqualification shall not be removed for a period of two years from the date that such test was administered or offered, whichever is later.

When training employees who are exposed to hazardous chemicals, the employer shall explain any physical or health hazards associated with the use of the chemical or mixture; proper precautions for handling, necessary personal protective equipment or other safety precautions necessary to prevent or minimize exposure to the hazardous chemical; methods of observation that may be used to detect the presence or release of a hazardous chemical in a work area, including, but not limited to, spot check monitoring, continuous monitoring, or methods of visual or olfactory detection; the labeling system and the material safety data sheet, and how employees can obtain and use the appropriate hazard information; and emergency procedures for spills, fire, disposal, and first aid. This information may relate to an entire class of hazardous chemicals to the extent appropriate and related to the job. Whenever any employer receives a new or revised material safety data sheet, such information shall be provided to employees on a timely basis not to exceed 30 days after receipt, if the new information indicates significantly increased risks to or measures necessary to protect employee health as compared to those stated on a material safety data sheet previously provided.</p>

            <p>§ 45-23-2. Legislative finding and declaration
The General Assembly finds that the manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs in an unlawful manner is a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. It is declared to be a primary purpose and goal of this state, of all of its agencies and instrumentalities, and of all of its public officials and employees to take all reasonable steps possible to eradicate the unlawful manufacture, distribution, sale, and possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs. With this purpose in mind, the General Assembly declares that its work force must be absolutely free of any person who would knowingly manufacture, distribute, sell, or possess a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug in an unlawful manner.  For this reason, the General Assembly enacts this chapter.

            <p>§ 45-23-7. Continuance of employment for drug user; requirements and procedure
On and after July 1, 1990, if, prior to an arrest for an offense involving a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug, a public employee notifies the employee's public employer that the employee illegally uses a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug and is receiving or agrees to receive treatment under a drug abuse treatment and education program licensed under Chapter 5 of Title 26 and approved by: (1) the State Personnel Board in the case of employees employed by departments or agencies subject to the board's rules and regulations, as such terms are defined in Code Section 45-20-2; or (2) the public employer having management and control of the employee in the case of other public employees, the public employee shall be entitled to maintain the employee's public employment for up to one year as long as the employee follows the treatment plan. During this period, the public employee shall not be separated from public employment solely on the basis of the employee's drug dependence, but the employee's work activities may be restructured if practicable to protect persons or property. No statement made by an employee to a supervisor of the public employee or other person in order to comply with this Code section shall be admissible in any civil, administrative, or criminal proceeding as evidence against the public employee. The rights granted by this Code section shall be available to a public employee only once during a five-year period and shall not apply to any public employee who has refused to be tested or who has tested positive for a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug.

              <p>of Code Section 45-24-8, the commission chairperson shall schedule a meeting of the commission to review the release or separation. Five members of the commission shall be a quorum. At the meeting, the employer shall have the burden of convincing the commission that the involuntary separation is necessary, justified, and in the best interests of the state. The commission may request as much information and may meet as many times on each case as it deems necessary to reach an informed decision. No action shall be taken on the separation of the officer or employee until the commission makes a final determination as to whether the separation is necessary, justified, and in the best interests of the state.

            <p>§ 45-24-7. Authorization to proceed with separation
If the commission by majority vote of those members present approves the involuntary separation, the employer is authorized, but not required, to proceed with the separation. If the employer proceeds with such separation, the employer shall not be eligible to have any increase in the number of employees in that employing unit for the next two fiscal years. If the commission rejects the involuntary separation, the employee shall not be separated, shall continue to be employed and compensated by the employer, and shall not be the subject of a proposed involuntary separation more than once every two years. As used in this Code section, the term "number of employees" means the total number of employees immediately prior to the involuntary separation, not counting any employee to be involuntarily separated.

          <content>
            <p>§ 45-4-29. Measure of damages in actions on official bonds
The measure of damages recoverable in actions upon all official bonds for the misconduct of the officer, unless otherwise specially enacted, shall be the amount of injury actually sustained, including the reasonable expenses of the action to the plaintiff and the costs of court. In all cases when little or no damage is actually sustained and the officer has not acted in good faith, the jury may find for the plaintiff an amount as exemplary damages which, taking all the circumstances together, shall not be excessive or oppressive.

At the time appointed or at any other time to which the matter may be adjourned after a copy of the show cause order had been personally served on the person refusing to deliver the books, papers, and other office property, the judge shall proceed to inquire into the circumstances. If it appears that the books, papers, and other office property are withheld, the judge must order the same delivered immediately to the successor and on failure of the person so ordered to comply, the judge shall issue a warrant, directed to any officer of the county or of the adjoining county authorized to make an arrest, to arrest such person and commit him to jail, where he shall remain until he complies with said order or is otherwise discharged by law. At the same time and in the same way the judge shall command such officer to search such places as may be designated in the warrant for the books, papers, and other office property and to seize and bring them before him or some other official authorized to preside. If it appears that the books, papers, and other office property belong to the office, the judge shall cause them to be delivered to the successor. The payment of costs is in the discretion of the court. These proceedings do not interfere with Code Section 45-6-14 on this subject.

(C)  In addition to any other compensation and allowances

               be reimbursed for per diem differential and for actual expenses 
               incurred in the performance of duties as a member of the 
               General Assembly in an amount not to exceed $7,000.00 per year. 
               Expenses reimbursable up to such amount shall be limited to one 
               or more of the following purposes: lodging, meals, per diem 
               differential, postage, personal services, printing and 
               publications, rents, supplies (including software),

               $100.00 or less when such member leaves office, the equipment 
               does not need to be returned to the state. No reimbursement 
               shall be made for any postage which is used for a political 
               newsletter. No reimbursement shall be paid for lodging or meals

              <p>As an adjustment except as qualified below as to members and member-officers of the General Assembly, the annual salary of each state official whose salary is established by Code Section 45-7-3, this Code section, and Code Sections 45-7-20 and 45-7-21, including members of the General Assembly, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House of Representatives, may be increased by the General Assembly in the General Appropriations Act by a percentage not to exceed the average percentage of the increase in salary as may from time to time be granted to employees of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government. However, any increase for such officials shall not include within-grade step increases for which employees subject to compensation plans authorized and approved in accordance with Code Section 45-20-4 are eligible. Any increase granted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective at the same time that funds are made available for the increase for such employees, except increases for members and member-officers of the General Assembly. That portion of the increase determined by the Legislative Services Committee to reflect a cost-of-living increase based upon objective economic criteria shall become effective for members and member-officers at the same time that funds are made available for the increase for such employees. The balance of the increase for members and member-officers of the General Assembly shall become effective on the convening of the next General Assembly in January of the next odd-numbered year. The Office of Planning and Budget shall calculate the average percentage increase.</p>

            <p>§ 45-7-70. Purpose of article
It is in the best interests of a free society that citizens be fully informed as to the conduct of their government and that those who serve the public by performing services requiring special qualification, training, or knowledge and the exercise of discretion or judgment be known and identified. To ensure that the public may better evaluate the stewardship of elected and appointed officials in the use of public funds for the purchase of professional services from other than full-time employees, it is appropriate that disclosure be made of the use of professional personnel and of the fees and reimbursement paid for such services and incidental expenses.

            <p>§ 45-8-5. Bonds -- Fixing of amount and approval
The amount of the bonds of collecting officers and officers to hold public funds shall be in the amount fixed by the proper authority, unless the amount is fixed by existing general laws, and shall be approved by the proper authority and filed as required by law. Except as otherwise provided in this Code section, the proper authority to fix the amount of bonds and to approve the same is the officer or officers upon whom those duties are imposed by existing laws. Where the law does not designate what officer shall perform these duties, the proper authority shall be the officer, board, bureau, or commission having supervision over the particular office or officer. Municipality or county authorities shall be deemed the proper authorities as to fixing the amount and approving bonds of municipality or county treasurers and those acting as substitutes for municipality or county treasurers under local laws and as to all other collecting officers and officers holding public funds, so far as relates to municipality or county taxes or revenue, and shall be deemed the proper authority as to requiring additional bonds or strengthening security on bonds, as to allowing reduction or substitution of bonds, and as to discharging bonds from future liability, so far as relates to such officers.

            <p>§ 45-8-6. Bonds -- Liability of new or additional bond for defaults occurring prior to and subsequent to effective date
Where any collecting officer, officer to hold public funds, bank, or depository gives an additional bond or adds new security during his term, the bond in force at the time and securities thereon shall be liable for defaults occurring prior to the time the additional bond or security is given; and the existing bond or security and the additional bond or security shall be jointly, severally, and concurrently liable for subsequent defaults. If the order requiring a new bond so provides, the sureties on the old bond or bonds shall be discharged from future liability and the new bond alone shall be liable therefor. However, if the new bond so provides, it may assume concurrent liability with the old bond as to defaults occurring prior to the date of its being given, or, if the officer having the duty of approving the bond so consents, the new bond may assume sole liability from a date prior to the time of its being filed and the old bond or bonds may be discharged from liability from the date as of which such new bond is operative.

            <p>§ 45-8-7. Bonds -- Interest against principal and surety upon breach of bond; additional penalty for bad faith; attorneys' fees
Upon breaches of the bond of any officer, bank, or depository, interest shall run against the principal on the bond at the rate of 7 percent per annum from the date of the breach and against the surety at the same rate from the date of the demand on the surety. If the breach shall involve dishonesty on the part of the officer or bank, the official or county authority having jurisdiction to cite the officer, or any court acquiring jurisdiction over the subject matter, may, as against the offending principal in the bond, impose an additional penalty of not more than 10 percent of the amount of the loss and a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees. This penalty and award of attorneys' fees may also be imposed upon the surety by any court acquiring jurisdiction of the subject matter, in the event it is shown that the surety has acted in bad faith and has been vexatiously litigious or that it has filed defensive proceedings for delay only. Existing laws imposing higher rates of interest or penalties upon principals or sureties upon any of such bonds are superseded by this Code section.

The state treasurer shall sell as much of the collateral as is needed to provide cash to cover the amount of the default and expenses resulting therefrom.

Public body depositors whose deposits are secured in a multibank pool of a defaulting covered depository shall look to the assets of the defaulting covered depository. If such assets are insufficient to cover amounts owing to public body depositors, the state treasurer shall assess all covered depositories, except the defaulting covered depository, on a pro rata basis based upon a covered depository's percentage remaining share of the deposit of the public body; and a public body depositor shall have no claim, ex contractu or otherwise, against the state, depositories outside the multibank pool, or the assets of pools in a defaulting depository created outside the multibank pool. The failure of a covered depository to satisfy an assessment from the state treasurer in a timely manner shall be an event of default.</p>

            <p>§ 45-8-20. Citation of officer, bank, or depository to show cause; service of notice
If it shall become known to the official or authority having jurisdiction to cite for accounting that a collecting officer or officer to hold public funds has been guilty of any default or breach of duty as to any tax, revenue, or public funds; or that any bank or depository in which any tax, revenue, or other public funds have been deposited has failed in business or has failed to pay over on demand any such fund so deposited with it, or, whether default is alleged or not, upon the surety on any bond of the kind dealt with in this chapter, whether of an officer, bank, or depository, filing with such official or authority having jurisdiction to cite for accounting a petition asking for the settlement of the accounts of such principal, it is the duty of such official or authority to cite such officer, bank, or depository and their sureties to come before the official or authority having jurisdiction over the accounting, on a day named, to make an accounting or settlement and to show cause why execution should not issue, if any default be found. Such official shall cause such citation to be served at least ten days before the hearing, unless such service be waived, or the respondents consent in writing to shorter notice. It is not necessary to issue or serve the citation or notice to or upon any principal or surety who has filed or has joined in filing the petition for citation, nor is it necessary personally to serve such citation upon any officer or other person who, by absconding, absence from the state, or otherwise, prevents personal service; but it is sufficient in such cases to perfect service by leaving a copy of the citation at the most notorious place of abode of such absconding or absent person.

            <p>§ 45-8-24. Joinder of parties in proceedings for accounting; power of authorities to determine liability
In any proceeding for accounting under this chapter, there may be joined originally or by amendment, either before or after appeal, all such officers, depositories, banks, and securities on bonds of any of them as shall be necessary or proper for the full determination of any matter in controversy, and especially, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for determining the respective liabilities as between an officer and some other officer, between an officer and a bank or depository, between them or any of them and the sureties of any of them, or between sureties of any of them. The proper authority or any court which shall have acquired jurisdiction in any proceeding for accounting by appeal or otherwise shall have the jurisdiction to determine completely the respective liabilities of the parties as among themselves, as well as the liability of any officer, bank, or depository and the sureties, to the public body or bodies involved. The jurisdiction given in this chapter shall extend not only to the compelling of an officer and his sureties to account for taxes or other public money which he has in fact collected, but for money which it was his duty to collect and which, in the exercise of good faith and ordinary diligence, he should have collected; and such jurisdiction may be exercised against any public officer who has received or collected the money of any public body, whether or not it was a part of his official duty to receive it or collect it.

The official or county or municipal authority having jurisdiction to cite for accounting may, without issuing or serving a citation or notice, issue or cause to be issued an execution against any defaulting collecting officer, officer to hold public funds, or any bank or depository in which public funds have been deposited and the sureties on the bonds of any of them for default as to any of the matters as to which such officer, bank, depository, or surety might be cited, and for the amount of the loss sustained by the public body or public bodies alleged in such execution to be sustained through such default. Such execution shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts therein recited, including the amount of loss sustained, and shall be enforceable as an execution for said amount; provided, however, that the enforcement of such execution may be arrested by proceedings in equity, or, after levy, by affidavit of illegality in which the defendant in fi. fa. whose property has been levied on shall deny liability for the amount set out in such execution or some part thereof. The affidavit of illegality shall be returned by the levying officer to the superior court of the county in which the alleged defaulting officer resides. On the trial of the case, whether in equity or on affidavit of illegality, the burden of proof shall be on the official or authority issuing the execution. Any other person, corporation, or public body at interest may on his or its own motion or on motion of either party to the cause be made a party thereto and be bound by the final judgment. Such an execution shall become final process against any defendant in execution named therein who shall endorse thereon in writing his admission of the correctness of the same and an agreement that the same shall proceed against him as final process, but such admission shall not be binding on anyone except the person or corporation signing the same.

            <p>§ 45-8-27. Procedure for accounting when officer succeeds himself
When any officer to whom this chapter relates shall succeed himself in office or has been elected to succeed himself in office or has been elected to succeed himself in a subsequent term, such officer or the surety on his bond either for the current term or for the term which has or shall have expired, or for a term about to begin, may file with the official or the county or municipal authority having jurisdiction to cite for accounting a petition asking that an accounting be had as to the acts of such officer during the term which has ended or is about to end. Such official or county or municipal authority shall then cause a citation to issue and be served on the officer and the sureties on his bonds for both terms, except such of them as shall be party to or join in the petition; and such further proceedings shall be had as are provided for in Code Section 45-8-20 in cases of citation for accounting. In the order or judgment rendered by the official or county or municipal authority conducting the accounting, or, in case of appeal, in the judgment of the court, the condition of the accounts of such officers shall be stated as between the two terms and as between the sureties for the respective terms; and the order or judgment shall set the terms upon compliance with which the sureties on the bond for the expired or expiring term shall be discharged or liability as to taxes, revenues, and public moneys satisfied; and it shall also settle and determine between the sureties in the respective bonds the matters for which each is or may be liable.

            <p>§ 45-8-29. Effect of judgment or execution as lien; transfer of judgment or execution; enforcement by transferee; effect of sale or transfer of assets by bank to innocent purchaser for value
Any judgment or execution issued in pursuance of this chapter or in any action against the principal or surety upon any bond of any of the officers, banks, or depositories dealt with in this chapter shall have the effect of preserving and shall be a means of enforcing the liens created by the laws of this state, including this chapter, upon the property and assets of the principal and sureties on the bonds of officers and depositories and the assets of banks. Upon the payment of the amount of such judgment or execution by any surety or other person, either the official or county or municipal authority issuing the same or any officer authorized to levy the execution shall, at the request of the person or corporation making the payment, transfer the judgment or execution to such person or corporation or his or its order, and the transferee shall be entitled to enforce the same and the lien therein represented, provided that, in order to preserve the lien as against subsequent bona fide purchasers for value, the judgment or execution shall be entered on the general execution docket as if it were a common law execution. Any sale or transfer of any part of its assets by a bank to an innocent purchaser for value in the ordinary course of business prior to the institution of a proceeding against said bank, through which the lien may be preserved or enforced, shall pass to the purchaser or transferee such assets free from the lien created in this Code section.

The commissioner may provide for endorsements for contractual liability and, where necessary or convenient to the public functions of the state, the commissioner may also provide for additional insureds. In such event, the commissioner may alternatively retain all moneys paid to the Department of Administrative Services as premiums on such policies of liability insurance or contracts of indemnity, all moneys received as interest, and all moneys received from other sources to set up and maintain a reserve fund for the payment of such liability under, and the expenses necessary to administer properly, a self-insurance program. If the commissioner decides to institute a self-insurance program, the commissioner shall establish and maintain a reserve fund for the payment of liabilities arising out of claims against officers, officials, and employees of the state and for any additional insureds. The commissioner shall also charge to state entities such premiums, deductibles, and other payments taking into account any direct appropriations as shall be necessary to maintain the soundness of the insurance or self-insurance programs established under this Code section.

In the event that a public officer or official has a money judgment returned against him in an action or is otherwise subjected to monetary liability by an aggrieved party, by his bond carrier, or both as a result of an act of omission or commission of a subordinate employee of the public officer or official and in the event that said public officer or official shall, as a result of such action, be required to expend his personal moneys, said officer or official shall be indemnified out of funds otherwise available to the public official's or officer's department or office, provided that authorization for such indemnification payment by the department or office shall be contingent on issuance of an official opinion of the Attorney General declaring that the judgment against or liability of the public officer or official was not due to an act of omission or commission of the public officer or official which constituted a breach of a duty imposed by law on the officer or official. In the event that the Attorney General is the public official seeking indemnification under this article, the Governor shall make the determination as to whether or not the liability of the Attorney General was due to an act of omission or commission of the Attorney General which constituted a breach of a duty imposed by law.
