In the event of default of the authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any revenue bond issue, any such holder, receiver, or indenture trustee shall be subrogated to each and every right, specifically including the contract rights of collecting rental, which the authority may possess against the state or any department, agency, or institution of the state and, in the pursuit of its remedies as subrogee, may proceed either at law or in equity by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceedings due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged directly or indirectly to the benefit of the revenue bond issue of which the individual, receiver, or trustee is representative. No holder of any such bond or receiver or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state; provided, however, any provision of this article or Article 1 of this chapter or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, any such bondholder or receiver or indenture trustee shall have the right by appropriate legal or equitable proceedings, including, without being limited to, mandamus, to enforce compliance by the appropriate public officials of Article VII, Section IV of the Constitution of this state; and permission is given for the institution of any such proceedings to compel the payment of lease obligations.</p>
