            <p>§ 4-12-1. Legislative findings
The General Assembly recognizes that persons who participate in equine activities, livestock activities, or llama activities may incur injuries as a result of the risks involved in such activities. The General Assembly also finds that the state and its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from such activities. The General Assembly finds, determines, and declares that this chapter is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly to encourage equine activities, livestock activities, and llama activities by limiting the civil liability of those involved in such activities.

            <p>§ 4-13-7. Disposal of equine by sale or euthanasia
If the owner of the equine cannot be found, if the owner refuses to enter into a consent order or to provide a written assurance that such equine will be given humane care and adequate food, water, shelter, and veterinary care, or if the owner fails to comply with this chapter after having entered into a consent order or having given a written assurance on a previous occasion, the Commissioner or his designated agent, the sheriff, any deputy sheriff, or any other law enforcement officer may dispose of the equine through sale at a public auction or by sealed bids or, if such equine is in a physical condition such that euthanasia is the only reasonable course of action, by humanely disposing of the equine.  Prior to disposing of an equine through sale or euthanasia, the Commissioner or his designated agent, the sheriff, any deputy sheriff, or any other law enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to locate the owner and, if the owner cannot be located after reasonable effort, the sale or euthanasia may proceed.  Any proceeds from the sale of such equine shall be used first to pay the costs of care given the equine and any funds remaining shall be paid into the state treasury if the equine was impounded by the Commissioner or his designated agent or into the county treasury if the equine was impounded by the sheriff, a deputy sheriff, or other law enforcement officer.

            <p>§ 4-14-1. Legislative findings and policy
The General Assembly finds that the breeding of dogs and cats acquired from public or private animal shelters, animal control agencies operated by political subdivisions of this state, humane societies, or public or private animal refuges in the State of Georgia results in the birth of thousands of animals who become strays, suffer privation and death, constitute a public nuisance and health hazard, and, ultimately, are impounded and destroyed at great public expense.  It is therefore declared to be the public policy of this state that preventing the breeding of dogs and cats acquired from such shelters, animal control agencies, humane societies, or public or private animal refuges be encouraged.

Swine mycobacteriosis poses a serious potential health threat to the people of this state. The swine farmers of this state have experienced and are experiencing serious economic losses due to the condemnation of swine infected with mycobacteriosis under the laws of this state. It is in the best interest of this state to seek the speedy eradication of swine mycobacteriosis in this state, while ensuring a supply of swine meat products in this state, and to provide for indemnification to those persons having swine condemned because such swine are infected with swine mycobacteriosis.

Any farmed deer or cervid which escapes from a licensed deer farm shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources and may be treated as an escaped wild animal which is subject to the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 27, except that, while such animal is roaming freely outside the enclosure of any licensed deer farm, the owner of such farmed deer or cervid shall have 48 hours from the time the escape is detected to recapture such animal and return it to the licensed deer farm. As a condition for maintaining a deer-farming license, it shall be the duty of the owner or operator of a licensed deer farm to notify the Department of Natural Resources immediately upon discovery of the escape of a farmed deer. When such notice has been given, no legal hunter shall be held liable for killing or wounding an escaped deer.

            <p>§ 4-5-6. Destruction of diseased and disabled animals which have been abandoned
For the purpose of putting a speedy end to the suffering of hopelessly diseased and disabled animals, any person finding any abandoned domestic animal which is diseased or injured past recovery may apply to any magistrate of the county, who may summarily decide whether such animal should be destroyed, after giving notice to the owner, if known, whenever such notice can be given without defeating the object of this Code section. The order authorizing the destruction of such animal shall not defeat the owner's claim for damages against the person destroying or procuring the destruction of such animal.

            <p>§ 4-6-8. Rules and regulations -- Administrative remedies of persons aggrieved by promulgation or enforcement
Any person affected by any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated by the Commissioner pursuant to any statute conferring such authority upon him, who believes that the Commissioner, in the promulgation of such rules and regulations or in the enforcement thereof, has gone beyond the authority vested in him by law or who believes that the Commissioner has exceeded any power which the legislature of this state under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of Georgia conferred upon him, is given the right to protest or object in writing to such rule or regulation or any act done by the Commissioner pursuant to such rule or regulation, as he may believe violates the legal and constitutional authority of the Commissioner, by pointing out in what respect and for what reasons he contends the act, rules, or regulations to be improper or illegal. The Commissioner is required to consider every such objection and afford the aggrieved party opportunity to submit evidence and argument in support of his protest; and if, in his judgment, the protest is in whole or in part well founded, the Commissioner shall take such corrective measures as are necessary to give the aggrieved party relief in every respect from any illegal or unconstitutional requirement. This Code section is expressly made an administrative remedy and every person affected by any rule, regulation, or act of the Commissioner is required to exhaust this remedy before pursuing any other remedy, provided that nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to deny any applicant for a license any existing right to a review by the court of the Commissioner's action as now provided by law.

In addition to the remedies provided in this chapter and notwithstanding the existence of an adequate remedy at law, the Commissioner is authorized to apply to the superior courts of this state for injunctions. Such courts shall have the jurisdiction, for good cause shown, to grant temporary or permanent injunctions or temporary restraining orders restraining or enjoining any person, firm, corporation, or association from violating or continuing to violate this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to this chapter. Such injunction or order shall be issued without bond and may be granted notwithstanding the fact that the violation constitutes a criminal act and notwithstanding the pendency of any criminal prosecution for the same violation.
