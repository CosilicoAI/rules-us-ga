          <p>When, in his opinion, the facts warrant, the Governor shall, by proclamation, declare that, because of unlawful assemblage, violence, overt threats of violence, or otherwise, a danger exists to the person or property of any citizen or citizens of the state and that the peace and tranquility of the state or of any area or political subdivision thereof is threatened, and because thereof an emergency, with reference to said threats and danger, exists. In all such cases, when the Governor shall issue his proclamation he shall be and is further authorized, in coping with said threats and danger, to order and direct any person, corporation, association, or group of persons to do any act which would, in his opinion, prevent danger to life, limb, or property or prevent a breach of the peace; or he may order such person, corporation, association, or group of persons to refrain from doing any act or thing which would, in his opinion, endanger life, limb, or property or cause, or tend to cause, a breach of the peace, or endanger the peace and good order of society; and he shall have full power to enforce such order or proclamation by appropriate means.</p>
