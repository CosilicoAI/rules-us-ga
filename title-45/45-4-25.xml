          <p>Actions on bonds taken from public officers may be brought by any person aggrieved by the official misconduct of the officer, in his own name, in any court in this state having jurisdiction thereof, without an order for that purpose. No such action shall be instituted or maintained in any other state. Except as authorized in this Code section, actions on bonds taken from public officers shall be brought in the name of the Governor and by his written consent or by the written consent of the obligee named in such bond, for the use of such aggrieved person; provided, however, that no action on the bond of any public officer of the state to recover damages flowing to the state or the public on account of the official misconduct of such officer shall be instituted or maintained unless brought in the name of the Governor for the use of the state and by his written authorization. Any such action on the bond of any public officer of any county or other political subdivision of the state to recover damages flowing to such county or other political subdivision or the public shall not be instituted or maintained unless brought in the name of the obligee in such bond for the use of such political subdivision and by the written authorization of the governing body of such political subdivision.</p>
