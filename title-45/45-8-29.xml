          <p>Any judgment or execution issued in pursuance of this chapter or in any action against the principal or surety upon any bond of any of the officers, banks, or depositories dealt with in this chapter shall have the effect of preserving and shall be a means of enforcing the liens created by the laws of this state, including this chapter, upon the property and assets of the principal and sureties on the bonds of officers and depositories and the assets of banks. Upon the payment of the amount of such judgment or execution by any surety or other person, either the official or county or municipal authority issuing the same or any officer authorized to levy the execution shall, at the request of the person or corporation making the payment, transfer the judgment or execution to such person or corporation or his or its order, and the transferee shall be entitled to enforce the same and the lien therein represented, provided that, in order to preserve the lien as against subsequent bona fide purchasers for value, the judgment or execution shall be entered on the general execution docket as if it were a common law execution. Any sale or transfer of any part of its assets by a bank to an innocent purchaser for value in the ordinary course of business prior to the institution of a proceeding against said bank, through which the lien may be preserved or enforced, shall pass to the purchaser or transferee such assets free from the lien created in this Code section.</p>
