          <p>If it shall become known to the official or authority having jurisdiction to cite for accounting that a collecting officer or officer to hold public funds has been guilty of any default or breach of duty as to any tax, revenue, or public funds; or that any bank or depository in which any tax, revenue, or other public funds have been deposited has failed in business or has failed to pay over on demand any such fund so deposited with it, or, whether default is alleged or not, upon the surety on any bond of the kind dealt with in this chapter, whether of an officer, bank, or depository, filing with such official or authority having jurisdiction to cite for accounting a petition asking for the settlement of the accounts of such principal, it is the duty of such official or authority to cite such officer, bank, or depository and their sureties to come before the official or authority having jurisdiction over the accounting, on a day named, to make an accounting or settlement and to show cause why execution should not issue, if any default be found. Such official shall cause such citation to be served at least ten days before the hearing, unless such service be waived, or the respondents consent in writing to shorter notice. It is not necessary to issue or serve the citation or notice to or upon any principal or surety who has filed or has joined in filing the petition for citation, nor is it necessary personally to serve such citation upon any officer or other person who, by absconding, absence from the state, or otherwise, prevents personal service; but it is sufficient in such cases to perfect service by leaving a copy of the citation at the most notorious place of abode of such absconding or absent person.</p>
