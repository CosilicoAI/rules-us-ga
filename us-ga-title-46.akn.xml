            <p>§ 46-1-5. Duties of Department of Human Services with regard to assistance to low or fixed income consumers of gas and electric service
By March 2, 1982, the Department of Human Resources (now known as the Department of Human Services) shall develop a program to identify those low or fixed income consumers of gas and electric utility service who, in the department's opinion, should benefit from public assistance in paying their bills for gas and electric service. The department shall also establish an efficient and economical method for distributing to such consumers all public assistance funds which will be made available, whether by appropriations of state or federal funds, grants, or otherwise. All gas and electric utilities shall cooperate fully with the department in developing and implementing its program. Nothing in this Code section shall limit the commission's authority to order regulatory alternatives which assist low or fixed income ratepayers.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code section, the gross revenues of a telephone utility shall not include revenues of such a utility received from the collection of interstate tolls, interstate access or subscriber line charges, interstate call charges, amounts paid by a telecommunications service provider to any other telecommunications service provider for carrier access charges, or any charges for any unregulated services.

Such notice shall be given by filing with the commission and keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating plainly the changes to be made in the schedules then in force and the time when the changes will go into effect. The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect without requiring the 30 days' notice by an order specifying the changes to be made, the time when they shall take effect, and the manner in which they shall be filed and published.</p>

              <p>of this Code section, the commission shall have authority, either upon written complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and, if it so orders, without answer or formal pleading by the utility but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, charge, classification, or service. Pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the commission, upon filing with such schedule and delivering to the utility affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a period longer than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect, provided that the commission may apply to the Superior Court of Fulton County for an extension of such period, as provided for in Code Section 46-2-57. After such hearings as are required, whether they are completed before or after the rate, charge, classification, or service goes into effect, the commission may make such orders as are proper with reference thereto within the authority vested in the commission. The commission is empowered to reduce or revoke any such suspension with respect to all or any part of such schedule. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order not made at the expiration of the suspension period, the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service shall go into effect at the end of such period; but in case of a proposed increased rate or charge, the commission shall by order require the interested utility to keep accurate account in detail of all amounts received by reason of such increase, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts were paid; and upon completion of the hearing and the rendering of a decision, the commission shall by further order require such utility to refund, with interest at the maximum legal rate, in such manner as the commission may direct, such p</p>

The financing charges shall accrue on all applicable certified costs as they are recorded in the utility's construction work in progress accounts pursuant to generally accepted accounting and regulatory principles as approved by the commission. The financing costs shall be based on the utility's actual cost of debt, as reflected in its annual surveillance report filed with the commission, and based on the authorized cost of equity capital and capital structure as determined by the commission when setting the utility's current base rates. These financing costs shall be recovered from each customer through a separate rate tariff and allocated on an equal percentage basis to standard base tariffs which are designed to collect embedded capacity costs. The commission shall retain the discretion to consider the effect of this tariff when setting the level of any senior or low income assistance it may authorize; provided, however, that the income qualification for such assistance shall be 200 percent of the federal poverty level.</p>

              <p>The commission shall, on or before December 31, 1990, implement a plan whereby all telephone companies subject to its jurisdiction will provide to each telephone subscriber, in addition to its present service arrangements and the intracounty service mandated under the provisions of this Code section, expanded community of interest toll free calling beyond county boundary lines and/or a reduction in intra-LATA toll rates to a level comparable to present inter-LATA toll rates.</p>

              <p>Any plan to implement county-wide local calling shall be subject to the approval of the commission.  In developing a plan, the commission shall require telephone companies to enter into negotiations to provide for county-wide local calling throughout their service areas.  If the companies are unable to reach an agreement within a time frame consistent with the requirements of this Code section and the instructions of the commission, the commission may impose its own plan.  The commission shall have the authority to determine the method of funding this service.  In determining the method of funding this service, the commission shall first utilize any available earnings of the telephone companies in excess of those authorized in their respective tariffs; provided, however, that the commission shall not mandate any plan that requires the transfer of funds to implement county-wide local calling from one telephone company to another unless or until all other remedies are exhausted. Any telephone company seeking to recover any portion of its expenses or lost toll revenues resulting from the implementation of such county-wide local calling plan shall demonstrate its financial hardship to the commission before such recovery shall be allowed.  It shall be within the discretion of the commission to determine the methodology and source of recovery for any such affected telephone company. Such methodology and source may include, but not be limited to, increases in the affected telephone company's rates and charges, sharing of lost revenues and increased expenses by any other telephone company included in the plan under review, and any other methodology which has as its goal the maintenance of reasonable telephone rates for all subscribers in the state.</p>

Such costs shall include, but not be limited to, engineering, administrative, and legal costs, the cost of environmental studies and control equipment, coal-handling and storage equipment, including rail facilities, equipment and facilities necessary to permit the combustion of coal, the cost of retrofitting or refurbishing boilers to permit the combustion of coal, the cost of on-site and off-site facilities for handling, storing, and disposing of wastes resulting from the combustion of coal, and the cost of all other facilities reasonable and necessary to allow the conversion of an oil-burning electric generating facility to burn coal. Such costs shall also include the reasonable cost of capital for such conversion and for carrying the cost of such conversion until such costs are recovered as provided in this Code section. In no case shall cost of conversion include any costs incurred pursuant to an expansion of an electric generating facility's generating capacity above the generating capacity of said facility that existed prior to the conversion from oil to coal.
(B)  "Cost of conversion" shall not include the amount financed by the company through tax-exempt pollution control bonds, if any, of any portion of the project certified by the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources, or other agency vested with similar authority, to be a pollution control facility and therefore eligible for financing under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder or other similar law or regulation now or hereafter adopted.</p>

              <p>of this Code section may file with the commission a request to establish an appropriate adjustment in its rates and charges in order to recover the costs of conversion of an oil-burning generating facility to coal-fired operation as provided herein. After receipt of such filing, the commission shall hold a public hearing to determine the cost of conversion of the generating facility and the fuel cost savings anticipated. Unless it is determined by the commission that the cost of conversion will be less than the projected fuel cost savings accruing to retail customers over the remaining life of the generating facility, no further action shall be taken by the commission. Upon making such determination that the fuel cost savings exceed the cost of conversion, the commission shall then determine the appropriate rate to recover the cost of conversion as provided in subsection</p>

              <p>In determining the appropriate rate, the commission shall consider the cost of conversion, and an appropriate period of time, but not more than seven years, to amortize such cost. The appropriate rate shall be an amount which is not less than the amount necessary to amortize the cost of conversion, as herein defined over a period of not more than seven years on a per kilowatt-hour basis taking into consideration the estimated kilowatt hours to be generated for sale by the utility during the first full 12 months in operation of the facility. In determining the rate to recover the cost of conversion, the commission shall permit recovery by the utility of the cost of conversion net of such federal, state, or local taxes based on revenue and income which may be imposed upon the utility for receipt of proceeds of the fuel-savings-allocation which cannot be reasonably avoided by the utility using due diligence. All revenues derived through the rate herein provided shall be applied solely to the cost of conversion of said facility.</p>

              <p>In any proceeding commenced after April 1, 2002, to determine the rates to be charged by a gas utility, the gas utility shall file jurisdictionally allocated cost of service data on the basis of a test period, and the commission shall utilize a test period, consisting of actual data for the most recent 12 month period for which data are available, fully adjusted separately to reflect estimated operations during the 12 months following the proposed effective date of the rates. After the initial filing, and until new rates go into effect, the utility shall file actual cost of service data as they become available for each month following the actual data which were filed. The utility shall have the burden of explaining and supporting the reasonableness of all estimates and adjustments contained in its cost of service data.

            <p>§ 46-2-55. Compelling witnesses to testify before commission as to the giving or granting of rebates or as to discriminations in rates and charges by common carriers
In investigating complaints of violations by common carriers of the laws prohibiting the giving or granting of rebates and prohibiting unjust discrimination in rates and charges, the commission may exercise the power and authority to compel the shipper or consignee, or any officer, agent, or employee of a common carrier to give evidence relating to such complaints. Before any such person shall be compelled to give evidence relating to such complaints, the commission shall make an order that such witness is required by the commission to testify and that he will be exempt thereafter from indictment or prosecution for any transaction about which he is compelled to testify. When such order is made, the witness shall be compelled to give evidence touching such complaints, and he shall be forever free from indictment or prosecution in any court touching the matters about which he is compelled to testify.

            <p>§ 46-3-126. Powers of authority generallyThe authority shall have all powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purpose and provisions of this article including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the power:
(1)  To sue and be sued in contract and in tort and to complain and defend in all courts;

(2)  To adopt and alter a corporate seal;

(3)  To acquire in its own name real property or rights and easements therein and franchises and personal property necessary or convenient for its corporate purposes, by purchase, on such terms and conditions and in such manner as it may deem proper, or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain in accordance with any and all existing laws of the State of Georgia applicable to the condemnation of property for public use, including the power to proceed as a condemning body under Article 2 of Chapter 2 of Title 22 or by gift, grant, lease, or otherwise; to insure the same against any and all risks as such insurance may, from time to time, be available; and to use such property, rent or lease the same to or from others, make contracts with respect to the use thereof, or sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of any such property in any manner it deems to the best advantage of the authority and the purposes thereof. The power to acquire, use, and dispose of property provided in this paragraph shall include the power to acquire, use, and dispose of any interest in such property, whether divided or undivided, which acquisition may result in the ownership of such property or any part thereof in common with any other party, whether public or private. Title to any such property of the authority, however, shall be held by the authority exclusively for the benefit of the public. The authority shall be under no obligation to accept and pay for any property condemned under this article except from the funds provided under the authority of this article and, in any proceedings to condemn, such orders may be made by the court having jurisdiction of the action as may be just to the authority and to the owners of the property to be condemned. If the authority shall deem it expedient to construct any project on lands which are subject to the control of the state or of any political subdivision or public corporation of the state, the Governor, in the case of lands controlled by the state, or the governing authorities of such political subdivisions or such public corporations are authorized to convey such lands to the authority for such consideration, not exceeding reasonable value, as may be agreed upon by the authority, as grantee, and by the Governor or by the governing body of such political subdivision or by such public corporation, as grantor, taking into consideration the public benefit to be derived from such conveyance;

(4)  To appoint and select officers, agents, and employees, including engineering, architectural, and construction experts, fiscal agents, and attorneys, and to fix their compensation;

(5)  To acquire, by purchase or otherwise, in whole or in part, as provided in paragraph (3) of this Code section, and to place into operation and operate or cause to be placed into operation and operated, either as owner of all or of any part in common with others or as agent, electric generation and transmission lines, works, facilities, and projects; to provide, by sale or otherwise, an adequate, dependable, and economical electric power supply to political subdivisions of this state contracting with the authority pursuant to authority of Code Section 46-3-130; and, through such political subdivisions, to supply such electric power to the members of the public in the areas served by them; and, as agent for such political subdivisions, to secure power supply contracts and arrangements with other persons. The authority shall also have the power, which may be exercised either as principal or as agent, to manufacture, generate, store, and transmit electric current for light, heat, power, and energy; to manufacture, buy, sell, import, export, lease, or otherwise acquire and generally deal in electrical apparatuses of all kinds and machinery and devices and nuclear or fossil fuels for the manufacture, generation, storage, and transmission of electric current for light, heat, power, and energy; to purchase power at retail or wholesale from any other person; to purchase or construct part of the capacity of generation or transmission projects sponsored and owned by or in common with others, making any such purchase at wholesale or retail within or without this state; to contract for the purchase of power and energy from, or the sale of power and energy to, the United States government and electric utility systems either privately or publicly owned, within or without this state; to execute long- or short-term power purchase or sale contracts on terms which may include agreements with respect to resale rates and the disposition of revenues; to interchang</p>

            <p>§ 46-3-127. Policy as to nonprofit operation of projects by authority; fixing of rates, fees, and charges by authority
The authority shall not operate or construct any project for profit except insofar as any such profit will inure to the benefit of the public. The authority shall fix the rates, fees, and charges consistent with this declaration of policy such as will produce revenues only in amounts sufficient, together with all other funds of the authority, to pay principal and interest on bonds and obligations of the authority, to provide for maintenance and operation of the authority and of its projects, and to maintain such reserves as shall have been created in amounts sufficient in the judgment of the authority for the security of the bonds and for the improvement, replacement, or expansion of the facilities or services of the authority or to provide fuel for its generating projects.

                <p>(A) It is recognized, however, that removal from local tax digests of the value of all property owned by the authority might impose an unfair burden on many taxpayers whose property is taxable. In the interest of weighing these benefits and concerns and arriving at an equitable policy regarding treatment of authority property, the General Assembly finds and declares that equity requires that the exemption presently applicable to the authority's property should remain in effect. However, the General Assembly also finds and declares that in the future the authority should rightfully make payments in lieu of taxes so that the authority may fulfill its good and public purposes without incidental harm to the state's local governments.
(B)  With respect to tangible property owned by the authority and included in its project one and project two, as those projects are constituted as of March 25, 1980, or thereafter under the authority's power revenue bond resolution and general power revenue bond resolution, and supplemental resolutions thereto, the authority shall begin making payments in lieu of taxes in such manner and amounts as provided in this Code section in the earlier of</p>

(D)  In each year in which the authority is required by this Code section to make payments in lieu of taxes, it shall file a return within the same time and in the same form and manner as public utilities.

            <p>§ 46-3-133. Failure of district attorney to pursue judicial validation of bonds
In all cases where the authority has adopted a resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds, and where notice has been duly served upon the district attorney for the purpose of securing a judicial validation of such bonds and the security therefor, and where, in such case, there has been a failure on the part of such district attorney or other officer to proceed within the time prescribed by this article, it shall be competent for the authority to represent such facts in writing to the court and to represent further that such failure has been without fault on the part of the authority. In such case, the Superior Court of Fulton County shall have power and authority to inquire into the facts; and, upon being satisfied that such failure has not arisen from any fault or neglect on the part of the authority, it shall be the duty of the court to pass an order directing such district attorney to proceed within ten days to file a complaint as authorized by this article. Thereafter, the proceedings shall be held in the same manner as would have been followed had such petition been duly and promptly filed in the first instance.

              <p>If the authority defaults on the payment of the principal or interest on any of the revenue bonds after the same become due, whether at maturity or upon call for redemption, and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or if the authority or its officers, agents, or employees fail or refuse to comply with the essential provisions of this article or default in any material respect on any agreement made with the holders of the revenue bonds, any holders of revenue bonds or a trustee therefor shall have the right to apply in an appropriate judicial proceeding to the Superior Court of Fulton County for the appointment of a receiver of the undertaking, regardless of whether all revenue bonds have been declared due and payable, and regardless of whether such holder or trustee therefor is seeking or has sought to enforce any other right or exercise any remedy in connection with such revenue bonds. Upon such application, the court, if it deems such action necessary for the protection of the bondholders, may appoint a receiver for the undertaking, provided that such appointment shall be mandatory if the application is made by the holders of 25 percent in principal amount of such revenue bonds then outstanding, or by any trustee for holders of such revenue bonds in such principal amount.</p>

            <p>§ 46-4-26. Filing with commission complaints regarding persons operating without certificate; cease and desist order by commission; hearing; final order of commission
Whenever any person is engaged or is about to engage in the construction, operation, or acquisition of any gas pipeline or distribution system, or extension thereof, without having secured a certificate of public convenience and necessity as required by this article, any interested person may file a complaint with the commission. The commission may, with or without notice, make an order requiring the person complained of to cease and desist from such construction, operation, or acquisition until the commission makes and files its decision on said complaint or until the further order of the commission. The commission may, after a hearing conducted after reasonable notice, make such order and prescribe such terms and conditions with respect to the matter as are just and reasonable.

              <p>At any time after notice and opportunity to be heard, and for reasonable cause, the commission may suspend, revoke, alter, or amend any certificate issued under this article if it appears that the holder of the certificate has willfully violated or refused to observe any of the lawful and reasonable orders, rules, or regulations prescribed by the commission or any other law of this state regulating these pipeline or distribution systems, or if in the opinion of the commission the holder of the certificate is not furnishing adequate service, or if the continuance of the certificate in its original form is incompatible with the public interest.

(a.1)  Any certificate issued under this article shall be revoked or amended by the commission upon application to the commission by a person to provide natural gas service to a specified end-use customer, property owner, or developer who has requested natural gas service if the holder of the certificate has failed to begin construction or operation of any pipeline, or distribution system, or any extension thereof, in substantially all of the territory covered by such certificate. Once a person has filed such an application, the portion of the certificate of the territory for which the applicant is seeking to provide natural gas service to a specified end-use customer, property owner, or developer shall be deemed revoked or amended. The commission shall determine whether the applicant shall be entitled to a certificate for the territory that has been excluded from the certificate by revocation or amendment, whether such territory should be re-issued to the person who held the certificate at the time of the application, or whether such territory shall be deemed uncertificated. The commission shall make such determination within 90 days of the application and shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in subsection</p>

The commission in determining whether to reissue a certificate to the person who held the certificate at the time of the application shall consider the length of time the certificate was held without service being provided.

Whenever a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been issued to a gas distribution system and a controversy arises as to whether an extension of service should or should not be made within the territory included in the certificate, the commission shall have jurisdiction to determine whether or not such extension shall be made and, if so, upon what terms. In making this determination, the commission shall consider the economic feasibility of that particular extension and the supply of gas available therefor. This Code section shall not apply to extensions of gas distribution systems by municipalities and counties of this state.

The commission is authorized to adopt such rules and orders as it may deem necessary in the enforcement of this article. Without limiting its authority to adopt rules and orders in general, the commission may by such rules and orders determine not only the locations or territories to be served but also the volumes of gas to be sold by pipelines direct to consumers. The commission may also define what territories are contiguous to others.

            <p>§ 46-4-56. Judicial review of commission's order
Any party appearing at the hearing who is directly affected by an order of the commission approving or disapproving a proposed underground storage project considered at such hearing shall have the right to judicial review of the order by filing a petition with the Superior Court of Fulton County within 30 days after the entry of the order by the commission. In the event no such petition is filed within such time, the order of the commission shall be final and conclusive. In such action the burden of proof shall be upon the party complaining of such order, and such order shall be deemed prima facie valid. Any person directly interested in the subject matter may, in the discretion of the court, be permitted to intervene in such action. Any party to such action may offer in evidence all or any part of the record of the hearing before the commission and any other relevant evidence. The practice, pleading, and proceedings in such action shall be equitable in nature. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a decree affirming or setting aside such order or remanding the cause to the commission with directions to modify such order so that it shall conform to this article. Such action shall have precedence over other matters before the court. Appeals may be taken by any party to such action in the same manner and to the same extent as in other civil actions.

              <p>The Department of Natural Resources, shall from time to time inspect and examine the methods of construction, maintenance, utilization, and operation exercised in connection with all underground reservoirs and the stations, wells, fixtures, machinery, and other facilities used in connection therewith, and shall inspect and examine the condition of all such reservoirs and facilities. One such inspection and examination shall be made each calendar year (at a time selected by the commissioner) by an independent qualified engineer employed by the gas utility and approved by the commissioner. A written report of such inspection and examination shall be filed with the commissioner and the Public Service Commission within 30 days after the time selected for the inspection and examination. Whenever the commissioner determines that any such underground reservoir or facility used in connection therewith is unsafe and dangerous, he shall immediately issue a written order to the gas utility responsible therefor directing it to correct such unsafe and dangerous condition within the time specified in the order. If the gas utility fails to comply with such order within the time prescribed, the commissioner may commence an action in the superior court of the county where the whole or any part of such unsafe or dangerous condition exists to compel the correction of same. If the court finds that such order is reasonable and just, it shall enter an appropriate decree compelling obedience to and compliance with such order and may grant such other relief as may be just and proper.

            <p>§ 46-4-80. Legislative findings; declaration of need
The General Assembly finds that certain political subdivisions of this state now own and operate gas distribution systems to serve their citizens, inhabitants, and customers by providing them with gas for all purposes; and if such political subdivisions are to furnish, and if the members of the public in the areas they serve are to receive, adequate service, such political subdivisions must have adequate, dependable, and economical sources of gas supplies. The General Assembly declares that there exists in this state a need for an authority to function without profit in developing and promoting for the public good in this state adequate, dependable, and economical sources and supplies of gas for the purposes expressed in this Code section, and to assist in the financing of additions and other expenditures for the municipal gas systems of such political subdivisions.

              <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section to the contrary, in the event it should be mathematically necessary in the election of the members of the authority for two members to be residents of the same political subdivision, then one of the two members who are residents of the same political subdivision shall be elected for an initial term of one year. In the event there are four political subdivisions from which two residents must be elected, one of the residents of one of such political subdivisions shall be elected for an initial term of two years.

            <p>§ 46-4-84. Authority members -- Representation of political subdivisions; eligibility of election committee members; successive terms
Each member of the authority shall be a resident of one of the political subdivisions represented on the election committee; provided, however, that an employee of the gas department or utility commission of a political subdivision represented on the election committee shall be qualified to be a member of the authority even though not a resident of one of the political subdivisions so represented for so long as he or she remains such an employee; but, insofar as is mathematically possible, no two members shall be residents or employees of the same political subdivision.  Representatives to the election committee shall be eligible for membership on the authority. Members shall be eligible to succeed themselves.

                <p>(A) It is recognized, however, that removal from local tax digests of the value of all property owned by the authority might impose an unfair burden on many taxpayers whose property is taxable. In the interest of weighing these benefits and concerns and arriving at an equitable policy regarding treatment of authority property, the General Assembly finds and declares that equity requires that the authority should rightfully make payments in lieu of taxes so that the authority may fulfill its good and public purposes without incidental harm to the state's local governments.
(B)  The authority shall make payments in lieu of taxes on its tangible property as provided in this Code section. It shall file a return within the same time and in the same form and manner as public utilities. The taxing authorities shall assess the tangible property of the authority which is made subject by this Code section to payments in lieu of taxes in accordance with the law and procedures applicable to public utilities and shall apply to such assessments in each year in which any such payments are due the appropriate millage levies of the state and of the political subdivisions in which such property is located in order to arrive at the amounts of the respective payments in lieu of taxes. The authority shall be notified of the amounts of the payments in lieu of taxes due and shall pay such amounts to the state and its respective political subdivisions within the time in which payments of taxes by public utilities are allowed or required.</p>

              <p>The acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, equipping, alteration, repair, or extension of any project, and the issuance, in anticipation of the collection of the revenues from such project, of bonds to provide funds to pay the cost thereof, may be authorized under this article by resolution of the authority. Unless otherwise provided therein, such resolution shall take effect immediately and need not be laid over or published or posted. The authority, in determining such cost, may include all costs and estimated costs of the issuance of the bonds; all engineering, inspection, fiscal, and legal expenses; the interest which it is estimated will accrue during the construction period and during such additional period as the authority may determine on money borrowed, or which it is estimated will be borrowed pursuant to this article; and all costs included in the definition of "cost of project" as defined in Code Section 46-4-81. Such bonds may also be issued to pay off, refund, or refinance any outstanding bonds or other obligations of any nature owed by the authority, whether or not such bonds or other obligations shall then be subject to redemption; and the authority may provide for such arrangements as it may determine for the payment and security of the bonds being issued or for the payment and security of the bonds or other obligations to be paid off, refunded, or refinanced. Such bonds may also be issued for the purpose of loaning the proceeds thereof to political subdivisions for use in their municipal gas systems and to finance any other corporate purposes of the authority.</p>

The authority may sell such bonds in such manner, at such price or prices, and upon such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the authority. The authority may arrange for insurance contracts, surety bonds, letters of credit, lines of credit, commitments to purchase, or other liquidity or credit support mechanisms and may remarket bonds to provide security to assure timely payment of bonds. The authority may by resolution delegate to such officers, employees, or agents as the authority's members may select the power to authorize the issuance and sale of bonds and fix, within limits prescribed in the resolution, the time and manner of their sale, maturities, date or rates of interest, and other terms and conditions the officer, employee, or agent considers appropriate.</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 46-4-103. Failure of district attorney to file revenue bonds validation petition
In all cases where the authority has adopted a resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds, and where notice has been duly served upon the district attorney for the purpose of securing a judicial validation of such bonds and the security therefor, and where, in such case, there has been a failure on the part of such district attorney or other officer to proceed within the time prescribed by this article, it shall be competent for the authority to represent such facts in writing to the court and to represent further that such failure has been without fault on the part of the authority. In such case, the Superior Court of Fulton County shall have power and authority to inquire into the facts; and, upon being satisfied that such failure has not arisen from any fault or neglect on the part of the authority, it shall be the duty of the court to pass an order directing such district attorney to proceed within ten days to file a complaint as authorized by this article. Thereafter, the proceedings shall be held in the same manner as would have been followed had such petition been duly and promptly filed in the first instance.

This article shall be for the benefit of the state, the authority, and every owner of the authority's bonds and notes and, upon and after the issuance of bonds or notes under this article, shall constitute an irrevocable contract by the state with the owners of such bonds and notes.

Upon such application, the court, if it deems such action necessary for the protection of the bondholders, may appoint a receiver for the undertaking, provided that such appointment shall be mandatory if the application is made by the holders of 25 percent in principal amount of such revenue bonds then outstanding, or by any trustee for holders of such revenue bonds in such principal amount.</p>

              <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or Article 4 of Chapter 3 of this title, the commission shall have authority to issue certificates of authority to an EMC gas affiliate but shall not have authority to issue certificates of authority to an electric membership corporation. The commission's order granting a certificate of authority to an EMC gas affiliate shall include terms and conditions to govern the relationship between the electric membership corporation and its EMC gas affiliate. The terms and conditions shall be designed to prevent cross-subsidization between the provision of electricity and the provision of natural gas services, to encourage and promote fair competition in the overall retail natural gas market, and to protect the privacy of both electric and natural gas consumers.</p>

            <p>§ 46-4-158.2. Rules governing marketer's terms of serviceThe commission shall by September 1, 2002, adopt rules governing a marketer's terms of service for natural gas consumers. Such rules shall provide, without limitation, that:
(1)  Each retail natural gas marketer shall establish policies and procedures for handling billing disputes and requests for payment arrangements, which must be approved by the commission;

(2)  A marketer's advertised prices shall reflect the prices or the pricing methodology in disclosure statements and billed prices and shall be presented in the standard pricing unit of the electing distribution company;

(3)  The consumer shall have a right to contact the commission if he or she is not satisfied with the response of the marketer;

(4)  Marketers shall provide all consumers with a three-day right of rescission following the receipt of the disclosure statement, which shall be provided to consumers at times specified in rules and regulations of the commission. Consumers may cancel an agreement in writing or electronically by contacting the marketer;

(5)  Whenever a marketer offers a fixed term agreement and the expiration date of such agreement is approaching, or whenever a marketer proposes to change its terms of service under any type of agreement, the marketer shall provide written notification to the natural gas consumer, clearly explaining the consumer's options at that point, including, but not limited to, the option to seek another marketer;

(6)  A marketer shall not charge cancellation fees to a low-income residential consumer seeking service for the first time from the regulated provider;

(7)  Gas service to a consumer shall be disconnected only for failure to pay for service from the consumer's current marketer. A marketer may not request disconnection of service for nonpayment of a bill which was not sent to the consumer in a timely manner. Every marketer shall be required to offer at least one reasonable payment arrangement in writing to a consumer prior to requesting that such consumer be disconnected for failure to pay. Disconnection of service to a consumer is authorized no earlier than 15 days after a notice that service will be disconnected;

(8)  Marketers shall be prohibited from sending estimated bills to natural gas consumers; provided, however, that when information from actual meter readings is not made available by the electing distribution company or any other party authorized to perform meter reading, marketers may send an estimated bill for not more than two consecutive months; and

(9)  No marketer shall be authorized to prevent a consumer from obtaining distribution and commodity sales service from another marketer or provider.

                <p>Each municipal authority may, no more than once annually, audit the business records of a telephone company to the extent necessary to ensure payment in accordance with this Code section. As used in this Code section, "audit" means a comprehensive review of the records of a company which is reasonably related to the calculation and payment of due compensation. Once any audited period of a company has been the subject of a requested audit, such audited period of such company shall not again be the subject of any audit. In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of due compensation due to an affected municipal authority under this Code section, an action may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by an affected municipal authority seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due or by a company seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment; provided, however, that any such action shall be brought within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates, although such time period may be extended by written agreement between the company and such affected municipal authority. Each party shall bear the party's own costs incurred in connection with any dispute. The auditing municipal authority shall bear the cost of the audit; provided, however, that if an affected municipal authority files an action to recover alleged underpayments of due compensation and a court of competent jurisdiction determines the company has underpaid due compensation due for any 12 month period by 10 percent or more, such company shall be required to pay such municipal authority's reasonable costs associated with such audit along with any due compensation underpayments; provided, further, that late payments shall not apply. All undisputed amounts due to a municipal authority resulting from an audit shall be paid to the municipal authority within 45 days, or interest shall accrue.</p>

In calculating such contributions, the commission shall allow a local exchange company holding a certificate of authority issued by the commission after July 1, 1995, and before January 1, 2010, with primary headquarters in Georgia and more than 750 full-time employees working in Georgia as of January 1, 2010, to utilize accumulated unexpired Georgia net operating losses for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 2010, on a full dollar-for-dollar basis to reduce up to 50 percent of its contribution to the Universal Access Fund. Within the same tax year of the election, companies making such election shall formally notify the Department of Revenue that the company agrees to forego any rights or claims to the Georgia net operating losses so used. The commission may allow any telecommunications company certified as a competitive local exchange carrier to request a hearing seeking relief from this contribution requirement upon application, demonstration, and good cause shown that such competitive local exchange carrier does not receive a benefit from the reduction in intrastate switched access charges pursuant to subsection</p>

A local exchange company may not charge a residential customer or single line business for basic local exchange service based on the duration of a call or on the time of day that a call is made; provided, however, that such restriction shall not apply in any case where a customer or business requests charges based on the duration of a call or on the time of day that a call is made. This Code section does not prohibit a local exchange company from offering discounts based on the time of day that a call is made if the company also offers basic local exchange service at a rate permitted under Code Section 46-5-166.

When a customer initiates a new type of such third-party service or changes the type or types of such third-party service received, the invoice for such new or changed services must state the charges for such services in a clear, conspicuous, separate, and distinct manner so as to ensure that the customer is aware of the new or changed charges. Any telecommunications company that charges a customer for a service which is provided to the customer by a nonaffiliated third party must provide to such customer the ability to block the nonaffiliated third-party service and any charges associated with such service.</p>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this article, any other activity or conduct engaged in during the course of changing a customer's primary local exchange or long distance carrier which is intended to mislead, deceive, confuse, or perpetrate a fraud or unfair or deceptive act or practice shall constitute cause, within the discretion of the commission, to invoke the penalties or revocation, or both, described in this Code section.

          <content>
            <p>§ 46-5-191. Cause of action for damages resulting from violations of this article
In the event that the remedies provided by Code Section 46-5-185 fail to restore a person or entity to that person's or entity's selected primary carrier of local exchange or long distance service and fail to reimburse the person or entity for the difference between the charges for the unauthorized and the authorized service, within 90 days of the person's or entity's report of an unwanted, unauthorized change of a primary local exchange or long distance carrier to the carriers or the commission as provided in Code Section 46-5-185, then such person or entity whose primary carrier of local exchange or long distance service has been switched in violation of this article may bring an action to recover damages from the telecommunications company responsible for the violation. The superior, magistrate, and state courts of this state shall have jurisdiction over such actions. Notwithstanding any provision of Code Section 46-2-9 to the contrary, such action may be brought in any county of this state in which the telecommunications company transacts business within 24 months of the date of the unauthorized switch of a primary carrier; provided, however, that the running of the statute of limitations shall be tolled during the 90 day period during which the matter is under investigation pursuant to Code Section 46-5-185. Such action shall proceed in all respects like other civil suits for damages, except that on the trial of such suits any findings of the commission made pursuant to Code Section 46-5-190 shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts stated therein, and damages shall be calculated as three times the amount of the difference between the charges for the unauthorized and the authorized service from the date of the unauthorized switch in the complainant's service. A prevailing plaintiff shall be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation incurred in connection with an action brought under this Code section.

            <p>§ 46-5-252. Prohibition against passing cost of compliance on to consumers
No company providing retail telecommunications service shall impose a separate line item or surcharge on customers' bills to recover any costs of complying with any state law or regulations without first submitting to the Public Service Commission the methodology and data used by such company for approval by the commission; provided, however, that such a company shall not be required to submit for approval separate line items or surcharges that are specifically authorized or required by federal or state law. No fines or penalties imposed by the Public Service Commission shall be considered as a cost of complying with a state law or regulation or included in any such separate line item or surcharge, or as a portion thereof.

            <p>§ 46-8-100. General powersA railroad company organized and incorporated as provided in this chapter shall be empowered:
(1)  To cause such examinations and surveys to be made for the proposed railroad as shall be necessary for the selection of the most advantageous route, and, by its officers, agents, servants, or employees, to enter upon the land or water of any person for that purpose, provided that the company shall be responsible for all damage done to such property;

(2)  To take and hold such voluntary grants of real estate and other property as may be made to it to aid in the construction, maintenance, and accommodation of said road; but the real estate received by voluntary grant shall be held and used for the purpose of such grant only;

(3)  To acquire, purchase, hold, and use all such real estate and other property as may be necessary for the construction and maintenance of said road and of the stations, wharves, docks, terminal facilities, and all other accommodations necessary to accomplish the object of the corporation; and to condemn, lease, or buy any land necessary for its use; provided, however, that to the extent an issue arises over the dimensions of any such acquisition by a railroad corporation or railroad company which occurred prior to 1913, such dimensions shall be determined by reference to the documents evidencing any such transaction and by examining the official map of the railroad filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to the Railroad Valuation Act of March 1, 1913, Stat. 701, as amended, and such depictions contained on such official railroad map shall be conclusive as to the dimensions of any acquisition as of the date of such railroad map; provided, further, that each railroad corporation and railroad company shall file and record such official map of the railroad with the superior court for the county in which such land depicted on such official railroad map is situated. Any court of this state shall take judicial notice of the information set forth in any such official map properly filed and recorded by such railroad corporation or railroad company;

(4)  To lay out its road, not exceeding in width 200 feet, and to construct the same, and, for the purpose of cuttings and embankments and for obtaining gravel and other material, to take as much land as may be necessary for the proper construction, operation, and security of said road; and to cut down any trees that may be in danger of falling on the track or obstructing the right of way, making compensation therefor as provided by law;

(5)  To construct its road across, along, or upon or otherwise to use any stream of water, watercourse, street, highway, or canal which the route of its road intersects or touches, provided that no railroad shall be constructed along and upon any street or highway without the written consent of the municipal or county authorities. Whenever the track of any such railroad shall touch, intersect, or cross any road, highway, or street, it may be carried over or under the road, highway, or street, or cross at a grade level or otherwise, as may be found most expedient for the public good;

(6)  To cross, intersect, join, or unite its railroad with any other railroad at any point on its route, or upon the ground of any other railroad company, with the necessary turnouts, sidings, switches, and other conveniences necessary for the construction of said road, and to run over any part of any other railroad's right of way as may be necessary to reach its freight depot in any city through or near which said railroad may run, provided that the crossing of another railroad, either over or under or at grade level or otherwise, shall be at the expense of the company making the crossing, and in such way and manner, and at such time, as not to interfere with the railroad in the operation of its trains or the conduct of its regular business;

(7)  To receive and convey persons or property over their railroads by the use of steam, electricity, or any other motive power, and to receive compensation therefor, and to do all things incident to railroad business;

(8)  To erect and maintain convenient buildings, wharves, docks, stations, fixtures, and machinery, within or without a city, for the accommodation and use of its passenger and freight business;

(9)  To regulate the time and manner in which passengers and property shall be transported, and the compensation to be paid therefor, subject to any law of this state upon the subject, or any rule or regulation governing such matters by the commission;

(10)  To borrow such sums of money, at such rates of interest and upon such terms, as the company or its board of directors shall deem necessary or expedient, and to execute trust deeds or mortgages, or both, if the occasion requires, on the railroad in process of construction, or after the same has been constructed, for the amounts borrowed or owed by the company.

            <p>§ 46-8-124. Exercise of power of eminent domain by railroad corporations generally
In the event a railroad company does not procure, by contract, lease, or purchase, the title to the lands, rights of way, or other property necessary for the construction or connection of the railroad and of such branches and extensions as are necessary or proper for the company to reach its freight or passenger depot in any city in this state or as are necessary to reach its wharves, docks, or other necessary terminal facilities, the company may construct its railroad over any lands, any rights of way, or the tracks of other railroads upon paying or tendering to the owner thereof, or to the legally authorized representative of such owner, just and reasonable compensation for said lands or said right of way. If the compensation cannot be agreed upon, it shall be assessed and determined in the manner provided in Title 22.

Whenever any railroad company incorporated under the laws of this state or whose line of road may extend into this state has leased its line of road to any person and such lessee is in possession of the road, service on such lessor company may be perfected by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the president or other officer of the lessor company; provided, however, that if service cannot be had in this manner, then service may be made upon such company by delivering to the Secretary of State two copies of the summons and complaint, one copy of which shall be mailed by the Secretary of State to the lessor company at its last known address according to the Secretary of State. In addition, the plaintiff shall cause a copy of the summons and complaint to be served upon the lessee by the sheriff of the county where the action is brought or by his deputy or by the marshal or his deputy.

If the residence of the president of the lessor company is unknown to the plaintiff and his attorney, an affidavit showing the fact, filed with the Secretary of State, together with the petition, shall be sufficient, instead of the notice to the president required in Code Section 46-8-312, provided that the plaintiff shall not be compelled to bring an action against any such lessor and give the notice as provided in this Code section, but may do so at his option; but when such notice is given to the lessor, the judgment rendered in said action shall be as binding upon the lessor as though service had been made as provided by law for service upon railroad companies.

No act shall be deemed authorized under this Code section which is inhibited by any provision of the Constitution of Georgia or by any provision of the Constitution or statutes of the United States, or which has the effect or is intended to have the effect of defeating or lessening competition or of encouraging monopoly.

Carriers as such are bound to exercise ordinary diligence. Common carriers as such are bound to use extraordinary diligence, and in cases of loss the presumption of law is against them, and no excuse avails them unless the loss was occasioned by the act of God or the public enemies of the state.

            <p>§ 46-9-2. Power of common carrier to limit liability
A common carrier may not limit his legal liability by any notice given either by publication or by entry on receipts given or tickets sold, provided that a common carrier may limit his liability by means of an express contract; provided, however, that a motor common carrier of household goods and office furnishings may require a shipper to declare a lump sum value for the shipment prior to loading or accept the per pound released value as provided in the terms of the bill of lading contract for the purpose of limiting its liability.

In order for a common carrier to avail himself of the act of God exception under Code Section 46-9-1 or the contractual exception under Code Section 46-9-2, he must establish not only that the act of God or the contractually excepted fact ultimately occasioned the loss but that his own negligence did not contribute thereto.

Any schedule of rates and charges established by the commission for the transportation of passengers and freight shall, in actions brought against any railroad company involving the rates charged by the company for the transportation of any passengers or freight, or cars, including actions involving unjust discrimination in relation to such rates, be deemed and taken in all courts as sufficient evidence that the rates therein fixed are just and reasonable rates or charges for the transportation of passengers and freight and cars upon the railroads. The commission shall, from time to time, and as often as the circumstances may require, change and revise such schedules.

            <p>§ 46-9-191. Lien of carrier for freight charges
When a carrier has complied with his contract as to transportation, he shall have a lien on the goods for the freight charges and may retain possession until the lien is paid, unless this right is waived by special contract or actual delivery of the goods. If the goods are delivered, the carrier acquires a lien for the freight charges on and may until the lien is paid retain possession of other goods belonging to the debtor which come into the possession of the carrier. The immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to consumer goods which are used or bought for use for personal, family, or household purposes, except when a motor carrier of household goods and office furnishings may retain possession of such goods.

No railroad company shall discriminate in its rates or tariffs for freights in favor of any line or route connected with it as against any other line or route; nor, when a part of its own line is sought to be run in connection with any other route, shall such company discriminate against such connecting line or in favor of the balance of its own line. Rather, such company shall charge the same rates for all and shall afford the usual and customary facilities for interchange of freights to patrons of all routes or lines alike. Any refusal of the same shall afford a right of action similar to that provided in Code Section 46-9-212.

          <content>
            <p>§ 46-9-275. Issuance of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations; refunding bonds
Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by an authority shall be paid solely from the property, including, but not limited to, real property, fixtures, personal property, revenues, or other funds pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered to secure or to pay such bonds, notes, or other obligations. All revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the authority, adopted by a majority vote of the members of the authority at a regular or special meeting. Such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times not more than 40 years from their respective date, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time, shall be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the members of the authority then in office and their successors. The authority shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems refunding expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this article. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded. There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which any authority may issue. Any limitations with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in the usury laws of the State of Georgia, or any other laws of the State of Georgia, shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of an authority.

            <p>§ 46-9-300. Authority of Governor to execute compact for a designated state; legislative approval of compact; text of compactThe Governor, on behalf of this state, is authorized to execute a compact in substantially the following form with the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and the General Assembly, by this article, signifies in advance its approval of such compact, which compact is as follows:
MISSISSIPPI-LOUISIANA-ALABAMA-GEORGIA RAPID RAIL TRANSIT COMPACT

ARTICLE I The purpose of this compact is to study the feasibility of rapid rail transit service between the States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia and to establish a joint interstate commission to assist in this effort.

ARTICLE II This compact shall become effective immediately as to the states ratifying it whenever the States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia have ratified it and Congress has given consent thereto. Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member states.

ARTICLE III The states which are parties to this compact, (referred to in this compact as "party states") do hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the Mississippi-Louisiana-Alabama-Georgia Rapid Rail Transit Commission (referred to in this compact as the "commission"). The membership of such commission shall consist of the governor of each party state, one representative each from the Mississippi Energy and Transportation Board, or its successor, the Office of Aviation and Public Transportation of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, or its successor, the Alabama Department of Energy, or its successor, and the Georgia State Board of Transportation, or its successor, and five other citizens of each party state, to be appointed by the governor thereof. The appointive members of the commission shall serve for terms of four years each. Vacancies on the commission shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The members of the commission shall not be compensated for service on the commission, but each of the appointed members shall be entitled to actual and reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings, or incurred otherwise in the performance of duties as a member of the commission. The members of the commission shall hold regular quarterly meetings and such special meetings as its business may require. They shall choose annually a chairman and vice chairman from among their members, and the chairmanship shall rotate each year among the party states in order of their acceptance of this compact. The commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of its business and a record shall be kept of all its business. It shall be the duty of the commission to study the feasibility of providing interstate rapid rail transit service between the party states. Toward this end, the commission shall have power to hold hearings; to conduct studies and surveys of all problems, benefits and other matters associated with such service, and to make reports thereon; to acquire, by gift, grant or otherwise, from local, state, federal or private sources such money or property as may be provided for the proper performance of their function, and to hold and dispose of same; to cooperate with other public or private groups, whether local, state, regional or national, having an interest in such service; to formulate and execute plans and policies for emphasizing the purpose of this compact before the Congress of the United States and other appropriate officers and agencies of the United States; and to exercise such other powers as may be appropriate to enable it to accomplish its functions and duties and to carry out the purposes of this compact.

ARTICLE IV Each party state agrees that its legislature may, in its discretion, from time to time make available and pay over to the commission funds for the establishment and operation of the commission. The contribution of each party state shall be in equal amounts, if possible, but nothing in this article shall be construed as binding the legislature of either state to make an appropriation of a set amount of funds at any particular time.

ARTICLE V Nothing in this compact shall be construed so as to conflict with any existing statute, or to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent legislation, or to affect any existing or future cooperative arrangement or relationship between any federal agency and a party state.ARTICLE VI This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each party state until the legislature or governor of each or any state takes action to withdraw therefrom. However, any such withdrawal shall not become effective until six months after the date of the action taken by the legislature or governor. Notice of such action shall be given t</p>

            <p>§ 46-9-326. Revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations
Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by the authority shall be paid solely from the property, including, but not limited to, real property, fixtures, personal property, revenues, or other funds pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered to secure or to pay such bonds, notes, or other obligations. All revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the authority, adopted by a majority vote of the members of the authority at a regular or special meeting. Such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times not more than 40 years from their respective date, shall bear interest at such rate or rates which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time, shall be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the members of the authority then in office and their successors. The authority shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems refunding expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this article. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded. There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which any authority may issue. Any limitation with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in the usury laws of the State of Georgia, or any other laws of the State of Georgia, shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority.
