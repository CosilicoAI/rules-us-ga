Every officer who collects or disburses any funds whatsoever shall faithfully keep the records of accounts as are required by DCS, which records shall be subject to inspection by DCS at any time.

          <p>The 2015 amendment,
      effective July 1, 2015, substituted the present provisions of this Code section for the former provisions, which read: "No probation supervisor shall collect or disburse any funds whatsoever, except by written order of the court; and it shall be the duty of the supervisor to transmit a copy of the order to the department not later than 15 days after it has been issued by the court. Every supervisor who collects or disburses any funds whatsoever shall faithfully keep the records of accounts as are required by the department, which records shall be subject to inspection by the department at any time. In every instance where a bank account is required, it shall be kept in the name of the 'State Probation Office.'" See Editor's notes for applicability.</p>
