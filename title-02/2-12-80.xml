          <p>The Commissioner is authorized to:</p>
          <p>(Ga. L. 1976, p. 359, § 14; Ga. L. 2019, p. 91, § 6/HB 512; Ga. L. 2020, p. 364, § 9/HB 1057; Ga. L. 2021, p. 469, § 1/SB 260.)</p>
          <p>The 2019 amendment,
      effective April 18, 2019, added the third and fourth sentences.</p>
          <p>The 2020 amendment,
      effective January 1, 2021, rewrote this Code section, which read: "The Commissioner is authorized to promulgate and adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to enforce this article. Such regulations may relate to, but shall not be limited to, methods of inspection and examination, designation of ingredients, and identity of products. The Commissioner is also authorized to promulgate and adopt rules and regulations relative to soil amendments derived from industrial by-products which may include, but not be limited to, application rates, proper conditions for application, application record keeping and retention, development and use of site-specific nutrient management plans, and storage and containment in or on lands where soil amendments are applied. The Commissioner is further authorized to share such information and consult with other agencies such as, but not limited to, the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources and the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service."</p>
          <p>The 2021 amendment,
      effective July 1, 2021, in subparagraph (1)(B), deleted "development and" following "retention," near the middle, inserted "soil amendments derived from industrial by-products generated solely from forest products, excluding chemical by-products of pulp digestion," in the middle, and added "; provided, further, that no such buffer or setback shall exceed 100 feet in width" at the end; and added subparagraph (1)(C).</p>
