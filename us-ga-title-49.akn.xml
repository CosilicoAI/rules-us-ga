Such actions may be maintained notwithstanding the fact that such violation also constitutes a crime and notwithstanding that other adequate remedies at law exist. Such actions may be instituted in the name of the department in the county in which a violation of any provision of this title occurs.

            <p>§ 49-4-15.1. Examination of financial records in instances of alleged fraud
The department may examine any books, papers, or memoranda reflecting the income of, or financial records bearing upon the determination of the eligibility of, recipients in instances of alleged fraud by recipients of food stamps and public assistance. This process may be implemented by means of a subpoena which may be issued by the commissioner of human services, upon the advice of the State Department of Law. In order to consider the issuance of such subpoenas, the director of the department's office of fraud and abuse must personally make application in writing to the commissioner of human services specifying why such information is necessary. If issued, such subpoenas shall compel the production of relevant documents. Subpoenas shall be served in the same manner as if issued by a superior court. If any person fails to obey a subpoena issued and served under this Code section with respect to any matter germane to the department's investigation, on application of the department, through the commissioner of human services or the commissioner's duly authorized representative, the superior court of the county in which the documents were required to be produced may issue an order requiring the person to comply with the subpoena and to produce the relevant documents.

Claims for medical assistance must be submitted not more than six months after the month in which the service is rendered and shall be in the form prescribed by the commissioner, except that the commissioner may, where he finds that delay in submission of claims was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the provider, extend the period for submission of certain claims for a period not to exceed 12 months after the month in which the service was rendered; provided, however, that such limitations shall not apply to claims timely filed pursuant to Title XVIII of the federal Social Security Act of 1935, as amended, and reimbursements of such claims may be authorized by the department so long as federal financial participation in such reimbursements is available.

              <p>In accordance with applicable federal law and regulations, including those under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, the department may make claim against the estate of a Medicaid recipient for the amount of any medical assistance payments made on such person's behalf by the department. A claim shall be made against the estate of a deceased Medicaid recipient only if at the time of application for medical assistance the applicant received written notice that the medical assistance costs could be recovered from the applicant's estate and the applicant signed a written acknowledgment of receipt of such notice, the estate is otherwise subject to recovery, and if no hardship or other exemption exists. The commissioner shall waive such claim if he or she determines enforcement of the claim would result in substantial and unreasonable hardship to dependents of the individual against whose estate the claim exists.</p>

The department shall be subrogated, but only to the extent of the reasonable value of the medical assistance paid and attributable to such sickness, injury, disease, or disability, to the rights of the recipient of medical assistance against the person so legally liable; the commissioner of community health may compromise, settle, and execute a release of any such claim or waive, expressly, any such claim, in whole or in part, for the convenience of the Department of Community Health. This Code section is cumulative of the remedies of the Department of Community Health which specifically include, but are not limited to, the use of hospital liens as provided in Code Sections 44-14-470 through 44-14-477; and further, the payment of medical assistance to a hospital provider shall in no way be construed to discharge the obligation of a third party to satisfy a hospital lien.</p>

              <p>The commissioner, for the purposes of investigating the nature, amount, and extent of services provided to a recipient of medical assistance or auditing information submitted to the department concerning a provider's entitlement to an amount of medical assistance, is authorized, personally or by his duly authorized representative, to administer oaths and to examine and copy books, papers, records (medical, business, or otherwise), or memoranda of a provider or of any other person possessed of information relating to reimbursable costs claimed by a provider or otherwise relating to the amount of medical assistance to which a provider is entitled. The commissioner may compel such examinations by means of subpoenas issued to require the custodian of such items to produce them for examination. A subpoena may be served by any sheriff, by his deputy, or by any other person not less than 18 years of age. Proof may be shown by return of certificate endorsed on a copy of the subpoena. Subpoenas may also be served by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, and the return receipt shall constitute prima-facie proof of service. If any person shall fail to obey a subpoena issued and served under this subsection, then upon application of the commissioner, the superior court of the county in which such custodian was required to appear may issue an order requiring such custodian to comply with the subpoena and to produce the subpoenaed documentation. Furthermore, if any provider shall fail to obey a subpoena issued and served under this subsection with respect to any matter concerning a claim for medical assistance, that claim for medical assistance shall not be reimbursed by the Department of Community Health; and, if already reimbursed, the amount of medical assistance reimbursed shall be deducted from any amount of medical assistance which may then be or thereafter become payable to such provider.</p>

              <p>The department is authorized to negotiate and enter into agreements directly with manufacturers and distributors whose prescription drug products are sold in the state for sole-source and multiple-source drugs to be paid for under the state plan for eligible recipients under this article.

As a result of the written request for hearing, a written recommendation shall be rendered in writing by the administrative law judge assigned to hear the matter. Should a decision be adverse to a party and should a party desire to appeal that decision, the party must file a request in writing to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative within 30 days of his or her receipt of the hearing decision. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designated representative, has 30 days from the receipt of the request for appeal to affirm, modify, or reverse the decision appealed from.

                <p>(A) A provider of medical assistance may request a hearing on a decision of the Department of Community Health with respect to a denial or nonpayment of or the determination of the amount of reimbursement paid or payable to such provider on a certain item of medical or remedial care of service rendered by such provider by filing a written request for a hearing in accordance with Code Sections 50-13-13 and 50-13-15 with the Department of Community Health. The Department of Community Health shall, within 15 business days of receiving the request for hearing from the provider, transmit a copy of the provider's request for hearing to the Office of State Administrative Hearings. The provider's request for hearing shall identify the issues under appeal and specify the relief requested by the provider. The request for hearing shall be filed no later than 15 business days after the provider of medical assistance receives the decision of the Department of Community Health which is the basis for the appeal.
(B)  The Office of State Administrative Hearings shall assign an administrative law judge to hear the dispute within 15 days after receiving the request. The hearing is required to commence no later than 90 days after the assignment of the case to an administrative law judge, and the administrative law judge shall issue a written decision on the matter no later than 30 days after the close of the record except when it is determined that the complexity of the issues and the length of the record require an extension of these periods and an order is issued by an administrative law judge so providing, but no longer than 30 days. Such time requirements can be extended by written consent of all the parties. Failure of the administrative law judge to comply with the above time deadlines shall not render the case moot.

                <p>A person or institution who either has been refused enrollment as a provider in the state plan or has been terminated as a provider by the Department of Community Health shall be entitled to a hearing; provided, however, that no entitlement to a hearing before the department shall lie for refusals or terminations based on the want of any license, permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, or other form of permission issued by an entity other than the Department of Community Health, which form of permission is required by law either to render care or to receive medical assistance in which federal financial participation is available. The final determination (subject to judicial review, if any) of such an entity denying issuance of such a form of permission shall be binding on and unreviewable by the Department of Community Health. In cases where an entitlement to a hearing before the Department of Community Health, pursuant to this paragraph, lies, the Department of Community Health shall give written notice of either the denial of enrollment or termination from enrollment to the affected person or institution; and such notice shall include the reasons of the Department of Community Health for denial or termination. Should such a person or institution desire to contest the initial decision of the Department of Community Health, he or she must give written notice of his or her appeal to the commissioner of community health within ten days after the date on which the notice of denial or notice of termination was transmitted to him or her. A hearing shall be scheduled and commenced within 20 days after the date on which the commissioner receives the notice of appeal; and the commissioner or his or her designee or designees shall render a final administrative decision as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>

              <p>If any aggrieved party exhausts all the administrative remedies provided in this Code section, judicial review of the final decision of the commissioner may be obtained by filing a petition within 30 days after the service of the final decision of the commissioner or, if a rehearing is requested, within 30 days after the decision thereon. The petition may be filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county of residence of the petitioner. When the petitioner is a corporation, the action may be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county where the petitioner maintains its principal place of doing business in this state. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the commissioner and all parties of record. The petition shall state the nature of the petitioner's interest, the facts showing that the petitioner is aggrieved by the decision, and any grounds upon which the petitioner contends that the decision should be reversed or modified. Judicial review of the commissioner's decision may be obtained in the same manner and under the same standards as are applicable to those contested cases which are reviewable pursuant to Code Section 50-13-19; provided, however, that no other provision of Chapter 13 of Title 50 shall be applicable to the department with the exception of Code Sections 50-13-13 and 50-13-15. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a stay of the commissioner's final decision may be granted by a reviewing court to a provider of medical assistance only on condition that such provider posts bond with the commissioner in favor of the state, with good and sufficient surety thereon by a surety company licensed to do business in this state, in an amount determined by the commissioner to be sufficient to recompense the state for all medical assistance which otherwise would not be paid to the provider but for the granting of such a stay.

Where the civil action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the civil action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative, administrative, or Attorney General hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing such civil action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. The remaining proceeds shall be payable to the State of Georgia, by and through the Department of Community Health, for the purposes of operating, sustaining, protecting, and administering the Georgia Medicaid program.

            <p>§ 49-4-169. Legislative findings and intent
The General Assembly finds that changes in the approval process of certain health care programs have made it difficult for children with disabilities who are eligible for medical assistance pursuant to Article 7 of this chapter to receive the services to which they are entitled with the frequency and within the time periods which are appropriate. Separate administration of the categorically needy and the medically fragile programs should not result in any variation in the amount, duration, and scope of services. Redundant paperwork requirements have hampered service approvals and delivery and reduced the number of providers serving children. It is the intent of this article to ensure that children with disabilities receive the medically necessary therapy services to which they are entitled under the Medicaid Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Program and that categorically needy and medically fragile children have available to them the same scope, duration, and amount of services. It is also the intent of this article to simplify the process and paperwork by which occupational, speech, and physical therapy services are applied for and received by eligible recipients.

The court shall summarily order a hearing on the petition and shall cause the applicant or recipient to be served personally with a copy of the petition and order at least five days in advance of the time and place for the hearing. Findings of fact shall be made by the court without a jury; and if the court shall find that the applicant for or recipient of assistance under this chapter or the payee, in the case of temporary assistance for needy families, is unable to manage the assistance payments or otherwise fails so to manage to the extent that deprivation or hazard to himself or others results or, in the case of temporary assistance for needy families, the payment is not being used for the benefit of the children, the court may thereupon enter an order embracing such findings and appointing some responsible person as a personal representative of the applicant or recipient or of the payee, in the case of temporary assistance for needy families, for the purposes set forth in this article; provided, however, that no employee of the Department of Human Services shall be eligible to hold such appointment. The personal representative so appointed shall serve without bond and without compensation. He will be responsible for receiving the monthly assistance payment and using the proceeds of such payment for the benefit of the recipient of assistance under this chapter or, in the case of temporary assistance for needy families, for the application of the payment to the best interest of the children. Such personal representative shall be responsible to the court for the faithful discharge of the duties of his trust. The court may consider the recommendation of the county director of family and children services in the selection of a suitable person for appointment as personal representative for the limited purposes of this Code section. The personal representative so appointed may be removed by the court and the proceedings dismissed or another suitable personal representative appointed. All costs of court with respect to any such proceeding shall be waived.

            <p>§ 49-4-186. Schedule of assistance to eliminate increment in benefits under TANF program as result of child birth during eligibility period
The schedule of assistance to be paid to a recipient family under this article shall eliminate the increment in benefits under the Georgia TANF Program as a result of the birth of a child during the period in which the family is eligible for TANF assistance or during a temporary period in which the family or recipient is ineligible for TANF assistance pursuant to a sanction imposed for failure to comply with eligibility requirements, subsequent to which the family or recipient is again eligible for assistance. The recipient family in which the recipient parent gives birth to an additional child during the recipient's period of eligibility for TANF assistance, or during a temporary period of ineligibility for assistance, may not receive additional assistance, except in the case of a general increase in the amount of TANF assistance which is provided to all program recipients. This provision shall only apply to recipient families who have been in receipt of cash assistance under this article for a total of ten months after May 1, 1997. Nothing in this Code section shall be considered to disqualify a recipient family from an incremental increase in assistance in cases in which the birth of a child is the result of a verifiable rape or incest.

            <p>§ 49-4-190. Construction of article
It is the intention of the General Assembly that this article be construed consistently with Part A of Title IV of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, and so as to authorize the Department of Human Services, within the appropriations provided to it, to administer the state plan in a manner so as to receive the maximum amount of the federal block grant available for expenditures made under the state plan. Nothing in this article shall be construed to impose requirements which conflict with such federal law or regulations promulgated thereunder so as to result in a loss of federal funding to this state under that law.

            <p>§ 49-4-191. Establishment and enforcement of standards and procedures by departmentThe department shall establish and enforce standards and procedures to:
(1)  Screen and identify recipients of TANF assistance with a history of being victims of domestic violence, while protecting the confidentiality of any such recipients;

(2)  Refer any such recipients to counseling and supportive services; and

(3)  Waive, pursuant to a determination of good cause, other program requirements for any such recipients of TANF assistance, such as time limits, for so long as necessary, residency requirements, child support cooperation requirements, and family cap provisions, in cases where compliance with such requirements would make it more difficult for individuals receiving TANF assistance to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize such recipients who are or have been victimized by such violence, or individuals who are at risk of further domestic violence.

              <p>The department shall provide child welfare agencies with advanced written notice of the scores to be posted. A child welfare agency may contest a score in accordance with department rules by filing a written appeal with the department within ten days from receipt of such notice. If a child welfare agency contests such score, the department shall note on the website that the score is under appeal, until such appeal is concluded. Within ten days of receipt of a child welfare agency's written contest of a score, the department shall hold a meeting with the child welfare agency and any affected agency whose score is contested. The meeting shall be for the parties to discuss the score and basis for the score. Within 30 days after the meeting, the commissioner's designee shall issue written notice confirming or revising the score. After issuance of such written notice, the child welfare agency may contest the score as a contested case under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," except that hearings held relating to such action by the department may be closed to the public if the hearing officer determines that an open hearing would be detrimental to the physical or mental health of any child who will testify at such hearing.</p>

              <p>If the department finds that any child welfare agency applicant does not meet rules and regulations prescribed by the department but is attempting to meet such rules and regulations, the department may, in its discretion, issue a temporary license or commission to such child welfare agency, but such temporary license or commission shall not be issued for more than a one-year period. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that such agency is making progress toward meeting prescribed rules and regulations of the department, the department may, in its discretion, reissue such temporary license or commission for one additional period not to exceed one year. As an alternative to a temporary license or commission, the department, in its discretion, may issue a restricted license or commission which states the restrictions on its face.</p>

No person shall bring or send into the state any child for the purpose of placing him or procuring his adoption without first filing notice with the department. He shall file with the department a bond payable to the state for each child he intends to send or bring, approved by the department, in the penal sum of $1,000.00, conditioned that he will not send or bring into the state any child who is incorrigible or unsound in mind or body; that he will remove any such child who becomes a public charge or who, in the opinion of the department, becomes a menace to the community prior to his adoption or becoming of legal age; and that the person with whom the child is placed shall be responsible for his proper care and training. Before any child shall be brought or sent into the state for the purpose of placing him in a foster home, the person so bringing or sending such child shall first notify the department of his intention and shall obtain from the department a certificate stating that such home is, in the opinion of the department, a suitable home for the child. Such notification shall state the name, age, and personal description of the child; the name and address of the person with whom the child is to be placed; and such other information as may be required by the department. The person bringing or sending such child into the state shall report at least once each year and at such other times as the department shall direct as to the location and well-being of the child so long as such child shall remain within the state and until he shall have reached the age of 18 or shall have been legally adopted.

The department may either perform preliminary records checks under agreement with GCIC or contract with GCIC and appropriate law enforcement agencies which have access to GCIC information to have those agencies perform for the department a preliminary records check for each preliminary records check application submitted thereto by the department. Either the department or the appropriate law enforcement agencies may charge reasonable fees for performing preliminary records checks.</p>

            <p>§ 49-5-65. Determination on the basis of fingerprint records check; revocation of license
After receiving a Federal Bureau of Investigation report regarding a national fingerprint records check under Code Section 49-5-64, the department shall make a determination based thereon and notify in writing the license applicant as to whether that records check was satisfactory or unsatisfactory. If the national fingerprint records check determination was unsatisfactory as to the director of an applicant's facility, after receiving notification of that determination, that applicant shall designate another director for such facility for which director the applicant has not received or made an unsatisfactory preliminary or fingerprint records check determination and proceed under the requirements of Code Sections 49-5-62 through 49-5-64 and this Code section to obtain state and national fingerprint records check determinations for the newly designated director. The director may begin working upon the receipt of a satisfactory state fingerprint records check determination pending the receipt of the national fingerprint records check determination from the department. The department may revoke the license of that facility if the facility fails to comply with the requirements of this Code section and Code Section 49-5-63 to receive satisfactory state and national fingerprint determinations on the director or to comply with Code Section 49-5-63 regarding employees other than the director.

As an alternative to the requirements set out in this article pertaining to obtaining preliminary criminal records check determinations through the department for employees, foster parents, and adults residing in a foster care home, but not including directors of centers, centers may obtain GCIC information through local law enforcement agencies. The center shall be responsible for reviewing the GCIC information obtained for the potential employee, or foster parent or other adult residing in the foster care home, and making a written determination that the individual does not have a criminal record as defined in this article. This written determination, together with all supporting documentation received from any law enforcement agency, must be maintained in the center's file and available for inspection by the department. This satisfactory determination must be made before the employee or foster parent begins any duties for the center. However, where there is an urgent need for an emergency temporary employee to work at a center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing requirements, such center may utilize the applicant as an emergency temporary employee after applying for the preliminary records check through the local law enforcement agency and completing the affidavit. In such emergency situations, the director of the center must complete an affidavit, with all supporting documentation attached thereto, stating that the GCIC information has been requested through an identified local law enforcement agency and that the results were not immediately available to the center prior to assigning the employee to work with children at the center's facility in order to avoid immediate noncompliance with staffing ratios. The affidavit with supporting documentation must be maintained in the center's file on the individual and available to the department for inspection. The director shall review the GCIC information upon receipt, but in no case shall an emergency temporary employee be permitted to continue working for more than three days without having a satisfactory determination made by the director and entered into the center's file on the employee with all supporting documentation. The department shall promulgate rules and regulations limiting the extent to which centers are authorized to use emergency temporary employees in accordance with this Code section. Foster parents and adults residing in a foster care home utilized by child-placing agencies shall never be utilized as emergency temporary employees of the child-placing agency. Employees, emergency temporary employees, foster parents, and other adults required to have records checks who are utilized by centers are subject to all other requirements set forth in this article. Where the department has reason to question the validity of the GCIC information or the satisfactory determination made by the center, the department may require the employee, emergency temporary employee, foster parent, or other adult to submit a preliminary criminal records check application through the department together with appropriate fees.

            <p>§ 49-5-73. Applicability of "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act"; consideration of matters in mitigation of conviction
A determination by the department regarding preliminary or fingerprint records checks under this article, or any action by the department revoking, suspending, or refusing to grant or renew a license based upon such determination, shall constitute a contested case for purposes of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," except that any hearing required to be held pursuant thereto may be held reasonably expeditiously after such determination or action by the department. It is expressly provided that upon motion from any party, the hearing officer may, in his discretion, consider matters in mitigation of any conviction, provided the hearing officer examines the circumstances of the case and makes an independent finding that no physical harm was done to a victim and also examines the character and employment history since the conviction and determines that there is no propensity for cruel behavior or behavior involving moral turpitude on the part of the person making a motion for an exception to sanctions normally imposed. If the hearing officer deems a hearing to be appropriate, he will also notify at least 30 days prior to such hearing the office of the prosecuting attorney who initiated the prosecution of the case in question in order to allow the prosecutor to object to a possible determination that the conviction would not be a bar for the grant or continuation of a license or employment as contemplated within this title. If objections are made, the hearing officer will take such objections into consideration in considering the case.

Further, it recognizes that to enable severely emotionally disturbed children to develop appropriate behaviors and demonstrate academic and vocational skills, it is necessary that the Department of Education provide appropriate education in accordance with P.L. 94-142 and that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities provide mental health treatment.</p>

(6)  Services shall address the unique needs and potential of each child and shall be sufficiently flexible to meet the individual needs of the child and family;

(7)  Services shall promote early identification and intervention;

(8)  Services shall be culturally and ethnically sensitive;

(9)  All legal rights of these children shall be protected; and

(10)  The parent or guardian shall be involved in the development of the individualized plan and the delivery of services as defined by the individualized plan.

            <p>§ 49-5-271. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds and declares that a large proportion of school-aged children in Georgia do not currently have access to adequate medical treatment and, further, that this lack of access can hinder a child's ability to reach his or her full physical and educational potential. The General Assembly further finds that federal funding made available to the states under Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act may be used to administer programs to provide such coverage. The General Assembly further finds the provision of adequate medical coverage for this population to be in the public interest and further declares the establishment of the program pursuant to this article to be a desirable and economical means of increasing access to such medical coverage.

            <p>§ 49-6-60. Legislative intent
The purpose of this article is to assist functionally impaired elderly persons in living dignified and reasonably independent lives in their own homes or in the homes of relatives or caregivers through the development, expansion, reorganization, and coordination of various community based services. In recognition of the desire of older Georgians to reside at home or with their families as long as possible, the General Assembly intends that a continuum of care be established so that functionally impaired elderly persons age 60 and older may be assured the least restrictive environment suitable to their needs. The General Assembly further intends to maximize the utilization of existing community social and health services in order to prevent unnecessary placement of individuals in long-term care facilities. The development of innovative approaches to program management, staff training, and service delivery that impact on cost avoidance, cost effectiveness, and program efficiency shall be encouraged. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of Community Health shall serve as the agency responsible for planning and implementing the provision of community based services to the elderly reimbursable under the "Georgia Medical Assistance Act of 1977."

              <p>Priority in provision of community care services shall be given to those individuals who have been certified for skilled or intermediate institutional nursing care service benefits conferred by the "Georgia Medical Assistance Act of 1977" and who need home and community based services in order to avoid institutionalization. Services may be provided to other functionally impaired persons as resources allow, as determined by the department.

              <p>All individuals seeking certification for benefits conferred by the "Georgia Medical Assistance Act of 1977," as amended, to be used to pay the cost of placement in a long-term care facility or individuals who would be eligible for such benefits within 180 days of nursing home admission, shall, as a precondition to such certification, undergo evaluation by an assessment team designated by the lead agency to determine if institutionalization can be avoided by provision of more cost-effective community based services. If the individual being evaluated requires community based services which, over a 12 month period, would cost more than the cost of care in a long-term care facility, then such community based services shall not be deemed cost effective. Such cost-effective determination shall apply to each case management evaluation. The assessment team shall, at a minimum, consist of a physician, a registered nurse, and a social worker. Whenever possible, the assessment team shall be responsible for the precertification for nursing home placement and determination of the appropriate level of care, as required by the State Plan for Medical Assistance, as defined in the "Georgia Medical Assistance Act of 1977."</p>

If the assessment team and the case manager have determined that an individual could be better and more cost effectively served in the community, the department shall not certify such individual for skilled or intermediate institutional nursing care service benefits until the lead agency has informed such individual of the availability of community based services within the lead agency's geographic service area and of the right of such individual to choose to receive those services as an alternative to placement in a long-term care facility. Such individual shall advise the lead agency of his or her choice of service alternatives. If such individual is otherwise eligible for those benefits for which certification is sought, the department shall certify the individual either for placement in a long-term care facility or for receiving community based services, as the individual advised the lead agency. The evaluation and certification shall be completed in a timely manner.</p>

            <p>§ 49-6-71. PurposeThe purpose of this article shall be to establish a comprehensive caregiver program which will marshal and integrate available resources and services to provide support and services to caregivers of chronically dependent adults. This article exists to coordinate assistance and maximize available services while maintaining and supporting existing services for caregivers. Such assistance may include:
(1)  Coordination and integration of information and services to caregivers in Georgia, including, but not limited to, insurance and benefits counseling, respite services available under the community care services program, the state respite or adult day-care program, or the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, and coordination with educational and other services offered by the caregiver resource center;

(2)  Assistance to the caregiver to assure that supports to the functionally dependent older adult or adult suffering from dementia are adequate and appropriate to maintain these individuals in the home;

(3)  Intermittent, planned, or emergency relief to the caregiver, either directly or through use of other available resources and services;

(4)  Restoration or maintenance of the caregiver's well-being;

(5)  Preservation of the caregiver's informal supports such as family and friends;

(6)  Supportive social services to the caregiver; and

(7)  Affordable services through a cost-sharing mechanism developed by the Division of Aging Services of the department for those families whose household incomes do not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

(3)  "Dementia" means: (A) an irreversible global loss of cognitive function causing evident intellectual impairment which always includes memory loss, without alteration of state of consciousness, as diagnosed by a physician, and is severe enough to interfere with work or social activities, or both, and to require continuous care or supervision; or (B) the comatose state of an adult resulting from any head injury.

(4)  "Department" means the Department of Human Services.

(5)  "Functionally dependent older adult" means a person 60 years of age or older residing within the State of Georgia who, because of his or her inability to perform tasks required for daily living, as defined by the department and as may be assessed through an area agency on aging or community care assessment team, needs continuous care and supervision.

            <p>§ 49-6-90. Mobilization for state response to Alzheimer's and dementia patients; intent
The General Assembly having declared that Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is a looming state and national public health crisis and having found that it is in the best interest of the state and its citizenry to address this issue created a Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan for the purpose of developing a strategy to mobilize a state response. The provisions of this chapter are enacted to further the intention of the State of Georgia to become a more dementia-friendly and dementia-capable environment for the citizens of Georgia with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. To further that purpose, the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan Advisory Council is created to ensure that focus remains on implementing and amending as needed the goals set forth in the Georgia Alzheimer's and Related Dementias State Plan.

            <p>§ 49-9-16. Lien upon causes of actions; procedure for perfecting lien; notice; fee; releases and covenants not to sue
Where a person with disabilities who receives vocational rehabilitation services is entitled to recover damages for said injuries, the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency shall have a lien, in an amount not to exceed the cost of rehabilitation services rendered, upon any and all causes of action accruing to the individual to whom such services were furnished, or to the legal representative of such individual, on account of injuries giving rise to such cause of action and which necessitated such rehabilitation services, subject, however, to any attorney's lien. In order to perfect such lien, the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency shall file in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county wherein the individual resides a verified statement setting forth the name and address of such individual; the name and address of the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency; the amount claimed to be due for such vocational rehabilitation services; and, to the best of claimant's knowledge, the names and addresses of all persons, firms, or corporations claimed by such injured individual, or the legal representative of such individual, to be liable for damages arising from such injuries. The Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency shall also, within one day after the filing of such claim or lien, mail a copy thereof to any person, firm, or corporation so claimed to be liable for such damages to the addresses as given in such statement. The filing of such claim or lien shall be notice thereof to all persons, firms, or corporations liable for such damages, whether or not they are named in such claim or lien. The clerk of the court shall endorse thereon the date and hour of filing in the hospital lien book, along with the name of the claimant, the injured person, the amount claimed, and the names and addresses of those claimed to be liable for damages. Such information shall be recorded in the name of the injured individual. The clerk shall be paid $1.00 as his or her fee for such filing. No release for such cause or causes of action or any judgment thereon, or any covenant not to sue thereon, shall be valid or effectual as against such lien unless the holder thereof shall join therein or execute a release of such lien; and the claimant of such lien may enforce the lien by an action against the person, firm, or corporation liable for such damages.

To effectuate the purposes of this article, it is declared to be public policy of the state that on any state property where the board determines it to be feasible to establish a vending facility to be operated by a licensed operator as provided in this article and where the agency or department or custodian of such property determines that such facility can be established without undue inconvenience to the operation being carried on in such state building or property, the preference accorded in this article shall require that such vending facility site not be deemed available for letting to competitive bidders for revenue-producing purposes unless the board declines to establish on such site a vending facility for blind persons or other persons with disabilities. The income to the agency or department or custodian controlling the space for such facility sites shall generally not be expected to exceed reimbursement for the cost of providing such facility site space and the services connected therewith; but in any case where such income exceeds those purposes, it shall be paid into the state treasury, subject to certification and audit.

            <p>§ 49-9-42. Operation of vending facilities on state property; preference for licensed disabled persons
For the purpose of providing blind persons or other persons with disabilities with remunerative employment, enlarging their economic opportunities, and stimulating them to greater effort in striving to make themselves self-supporting, such blind persons or other persons with disabilities who are licensed by the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency shall be authorized to operate vending facilities on any state property where such vending facilities may be properly and satisfactorily operated by blind persons or other persons with disabilities. In authorizing the operation of vending facilities on state property, preference shall be given, so far as feasible, to blind persons or other persons with disabilities licensed by the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency as provided in this article; and the head of each department or agency in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of state property shall, after consultation with the board and with the approval of the Governor, prescribe regulations designed to assure such preference (including assignment of vending machine income to achieve and protect such preference) for such licensed blind persons or other persons with disabilities without unduly inconveniencing such departments and agencies or adversely affecting the interests of the state.
