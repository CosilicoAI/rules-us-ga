The General Assembly finds that the manufacture, distribution, sale, possession, or use of marijuana, controlled substances, or dangerous drugs in an unlawful manner is a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare and to the academic achievement of students enrolled in the public and nonpublic colleges, universities, and postsecondary technical institutes of this state. It is declared to be a primary purpose and goal of this state, of all of its agencies and instrumentalities, and of all of its public officials and employees to take all reasonable steps possible to eradicate the unlawful manufacture, distribution, sale, possession, and use of marijuana, controlled substances, and dangerous drugs. With this purpose in mind, the General Assembly declares that the public and nonpublic colleges, universities, and postsecondary technical institutes in this state must be absolutely free of any person who would knowingly manufacture, distribute, sell, possess, or use marijuana, a controlled substance, or a dangerous drug in an unlawful manner. For this reason, the General Assembly enacts this article.

The board of regents is authorized, as owner of such projects as it may construct, to offer, as lessor, to lease such projects for terms not exceeding 50 years from the date of execution. Such leases may provide for the advance payment of agreed sums of yearly or monthly rental, which payments may begin on execution of leases, such dates being prior to the completion of such projects or otherwise, and may obligate the lessees or their successors, or both, to pay such sums for the lease of such projects and in addition, to obligate themselves to pay for or perform all maintenance, upkeep, and repair or any other reasonable expense of such projects, provided that no such lease shall be binding upon or a valid act of the board of regents as to a lessee where the lessee is any state government agency until and unless the board of regents shall have secured a certificate from the state auditor that the yearly rental obligations under such lease shall fall within the existing power of such state agency to make such obligations.

                <p>To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the Interstate Commission, the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney's fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.ARTICLE XII RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION  
   A.  Rulemaking Authority --  The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact; provided however, that in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. 
   B.  Rulemaking Procedure --  Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the 'Model State Administrative Procedure Act,' of 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p. 1</p>

                <p>as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate Commission.

C.  Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule, provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.

D.  If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.ARTICLE XIII OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

            <p>§ 20-2-49. Standards for local board of education members
The General Assembly finds that local boards of education play a critical role in setting the policies that lead to the operation and success of local school systems. School board members hold special roles as trustees of public funds, including local, state, and federal funds, while they focus on the singular objective of ensuring each student in the local school system receives a quality basic education. Board duties require specialized skills and training in the performance of vision setting, policy making, approving multimillion dollar budgets, and hiring a qualified superintendent. The motivation to serve as a member of a local board of education should be the improvement of schools and academic achievement of all students. Service on a local board of education is important citizen service. Given the specialized nature and unique role of membership on a local board of education, this elected office should be characterized and treated differently from other elected offices where the primary duty is independently to represent constituent views. Local board of education members should abide by a code of conduct and conflict of interest policy modeled for their unique roles and responsibilities. And although there are many measures of the success of a local board of education, one is clearly essential: maintaining accreditation and the opportunities it allows the school system's students.

School breakfast programs shall be phased in over a period beginning September 1, 1994, and ending June 15, 1996, in all such schools.  Each local school system operating a school breakfast program pursuant to this Code section shall be reimbursed by the state at the federal reimbursement rate per meal prepared and served.  The school breakfast program reimbursement by the state shall be automatically terminated if federal funding for this program ceases.</p>

            <p>§ 20-2-69. Requirements and procedures for issuing and awarding high school diplomas to honorably discharged World War II Veterans
Each local board of education shall issue high school diplomas to veterans who failed to receive diplomas due to an interruption of their education by service in World War II. The local board of education of the school district where the veteran attended high school shall award the high school diploma to such veteran. A veteran shall make application for a diploma to the appropriate local board of education and furnish proof that such person is a World War II veteran who had his or her education interrupted as a result of service in World War II. Honorably discharged veterans who served in World War II between September 16, 1940, and December 31, 1946, and who did not graduate from high school are eligible for a diploma; provided, however, that attendance in high school ranging from 1937-1946 with graduation class years ranging from 1941-1950 is required. Veterans who qualify under this Code section and who have earned a general educational development (GED) diploma are also eligible for a high school diploma. Diplomas may be awarded posthumously. The local board of education is encouraged to present such diplomas to World War II veterans on or near Veterans Day to bring to the attention of students the importance of such day and the great sacrifices made by World War II veterans.

                <p>Loss of governance of one or more nonperforming schools by the local school system in accordance with Code Section 20-2-84.1.
Consequences shall be incurred upon noncompliance of a local school system with the accountability component of its contract; provided, however, that if a local school system has been in compliance with the accountability component of its contract for at least three years, consequences shall not be invoked upon the fifth year of the contract, and such school system may request an extension of its contract and corresponding flexibility from the state board. If the local school system or a school within the school system meets the performance goals in its contract for such school system or school by the end of the fifth year of the contract, the school system or school shall be deemed to have met its contract performance goals. The schedule of interventions or sanctions, including loss of governance, for failure to meet identified levels of achievement or specified levels of progress shall be mutually agreed upon in the contract. If the Office of Student Achievement recommends to the state board that loss of governance not be included in a contract with respect to a high performing school, the contract may provide alternate terms with respect to that school.

              <p>The General Assembly recognizes the need to improve communication and participation of parents and the community in the management and operation of local schools. The General Assembly believes that parent and community support is critical to the success of students and schools. The intent of this article is to bring communities and schools closer together in a spirit of cooperation to solve difficult education problems, improve academic achievement, provide support for teachers and administrators, and bring parents into the school-based decision-making process. The establishment of school councils is intended to help local boards of education develop and nurture participation, bring parents and the community together with teachers and school administrators to create a better understanding of and mutual respect for each other's concerns, and share ideas for school improvement. School councils shall be reflective of the school community.</p>

              <p>By October 1, 2001, each local board of education that elects to participate in the Quality Basic Education Program provided for in Article 6 of this chapter shall have a school council operational at a minimum of one high school, one middle school, and one elementary school, except that if a school system does not have its schools organized in this manner the system shall designate schools for a school council as closely to the intent of this Code section as possible. By October 1, 2002, each local board of education shall have a school council operational in a minimum of 50 percent of the schools under its jurisdiction. Such school council shall operate pursuant to this Code section, and the local board of education shall assist all councils in their creation and operation. After two years of successful operation, and upon receiving a high performance designation by the Office of Student Achievement, the local board of education shall devolve to the school council such additional authority in matters of school operation as the local board deems appropriate. By October 1, 2003, each local board of education shall have a school council operational in each of the schools under its jurisdiction. Local boards of education may by board policy allow an alternative to a school council at a charter school, an alternative school, or a psychoeducation center if another governance body or advisory council exists that performs a comparable function.</p>

            <p>§ 20-2-990. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds that an urgent crisis confronts public education in Georgia. Evolving constitutional principles established by recent judicial decisions impose increased burdens upon school administrators and boards of education and subject them to personal liability under judicial doctrines so unsettled as to render it difficult to predict the legality of actions in advance. Consequently, responsible and competent persons declined to accept appointment and employment, with resulting detriment to public administration. This crisis has become so grave that immediate relief is essential to quality education, and the purchase of protection through liability insurance and contracts of indemnity, and the defense of civil and criminal actions at public expense, as part of the public compensation paid to such officials and employees, offers the only feasible solution. Therefore, the General Assembly finds that the expenditure of public funds for such purposes in these circumstances is for educational purposes and in furtherance of the support and maintenance of public schools and public education.

Such boards may expend state, county, federal, and local funds, or any combination thereof, for such purposes. The amount of such insurance or indemnity shall be in the discretion of the respective board. No action shall be maintained against the person or company issuing such insurance or contracting for such indemnity until final judgment has first been entered against the individual covered by such policy or contract.

            <p>§ 20-2-991.1. Including nonprofit organizations, their members, and school volunteers in policies and indemnity contracts
A policy of liability insurance or contract of indemnity purchased pursuant to Code Section 20-2-991 by a board of education of a county, city, or independent school system may, in the board's discretion, include provisions insuring nonprofit organizations, their members, and school volunteers against damages arising out of the performance of volunteer duties in support of the educational purposes of the school system, when such duties are authorized by the board or its designee; provided, however, that the inclusion of such provisions relating to nonprofit organizations and their members (1) has no effect whatsoever on the cost of the policy or contract so purchased either at its initial purchase or upon renewal and (2) does not require the expenditure of state, county, federal, or local funds for the administration of such provisions.

In lieu of obtaining the insurance or indemnity referred to in Code Section 20-2-991 or in addition thereto, such boards may, as part of the compensation and terms of employment of the members thereof and of the officials and employees thereof, adopt policies whereby the board will undertake to defend all or specified civil, criminal, or quasi-criminal actions brought or maintained against such members or such officials and employees arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based upon negligence, violation of contract rights, or violation of civil, constitutional, common-law, or other statutory rights, whether state or federal. Such board may expend state, county, federal, and local funds, or any combination thereof, for such purposes, including, but not limited to attorney's fees, court costs, deposition costs, witness fees and compensation, and all other like costs, expenses, and fees; provided, however, that any and all legal representation of the State Board of Education, the State School Superintendent, and employees of the state board shall be through the office of the Attorney General.

              <p>To educate students about the sacrifices made for freedom in the founding of this country and the values, principles, and philosophies on which this country was founded, it is strongly encouraged that the full week in September which includes Constitution Day, September 17, is recognized in public elementary, middle, and high schools in this state as Celebrate Freedom Week. It is strongly encouraged that Celebrate Freedom Week include approximately three hours of appropriate instruction, as determined by each local school system, in each social studies class. It is strongly encouraged that the instruction include an age-appropriate study of the intent, meaning, and importance of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, in their historical context including the background of the colonial era along with instruction about the Founding Fathers, such as the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, the first six Presidents, and particularly George Washington. The religious references in the writings of the Founding Fathers shall not be censored. During Celebrate Freedom Week, it is strongly encouraged that local school systems suggest that students in grades three through 12 read at least one book during the school year that focuses on the Founding Era, either the times and events or the people who made significant contributions to independence or toward establishing the new federal or state governments. In addition, local school systems are strongly encouraged to require students in grades three through 12 to recite at least one of the following three excerpts at least once during the week, and local school systems are encouraged to require daily recitations from one or all of these excerpts at the beginning of each school day:</p>

              <p>A public school may request funding assistance from the state for facilities, technology, or other safety improvements or initiatives, such as the installation of safety equipment, including, but not limited to, video surveillance cameras, metal detectors, alarms, communications systems, building access controls, and other similar security devices. The Department of Education shall establish criteria that will be applied in reviewing funding requests pursuant to this subsection which shall take into consideration the physical security needs of the public school in evaluating how the school safety plan and funding request will support such physical security needs. Funding may be provided to a public school in accordance with a school safety plan prepared by the school and approved by the local board of education, the local law enforcement agency, the Department of Education, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency; provided, however, that a public school shall be required to match the state funding with local funds unless the school can demonstrate a substantial hardship.</p>

(A)  Disciplinary or corrective action;

(B)  Transfer or reassignment, whether temporary or permanent;

(C)  Suspension, demotion, or dismissal;

(D)  An unfavorable performance evaluation;

(E)  A reduction in pay, benefits, or awards;

(F)  Elimination of the employee's position without a reduction in force by reason of lack of moneys or work; or

(G)  Other significant changes in duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent with the employee's salary or employment classification; or(2)  With respect to an educational program, results in one or more of the following:
(A)  Suspension or termination of the educational program;

(B)  Transfer or reassignment of the educational program to a less favorable department;

(C)  Relocation of the educational program to a less favorable site within the school or school system; or

(D)  Significant reduction or termination of funding for the educational program, unless necessitated by unfunded mandates from federal or state decisions which result in a significant reduction in funds available to the local board of education and which result in a proportionate loss of funding for all schools in the system.

A petition may be submitted pursuant to this Code section by an existing charter school approved by a local board of education or the State Board of Education provided that the obligations of its charter with the local board of education or State Board of Education will expire prior to entering into a new charter with the commission.

            <p>§ 20-2-2111. Legislative findings; purposeThe General Assembly finds that:
(1)  Students with disabilities have special needs that merit educational alternatives which will allow students to learn in an appropriate setting and manner;

(2)  Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their children, including the educational setting that will best serve the interests and educational needs of their children;

(3)  Children, parents, and families are the primary beneficiaries of the scholarship program authorized in this article and any benefit to private schools, sectarian or otherwise, is purely incidental;

(4)  The scholarship program established in this article is for the valid secular purpose of tailoring a student's education to that student's specific needs and enabling families to make genuine and independent private choices to direct their resources to appropriate schools; and

(5)  Nothing in this article shall be construed as a basis for granting vouchers or tuition tax credits for any other students, with or without disabilities.

              <p>Upon proper documentation received by the department, the department shall make quarterly scholarship payments to the parents of scholarship students on or before October 15, December 15, February 15, and May 15 for quarterly periods corresponding, respectively, to August 1 through September 30, October 1 through November 30, December 1 through the last day of February, and March 1 through May 31 during each academic year in which the scholarship is in force. As nearly as practical, such quarterly payments shall be equal; provided, however, that this shall not prevent payments from being adjusted due to budgetary midterm adjustments made pursuant to Code Section 20-2-162. The state auditor shall cite as an audit exception any failure by the department to meet any payment deadlines and shall include such audit exceptions on the website established pursuant to Code Section 50-6-32. The initial payment shall be made upon evidence of admission to the participating school, and subsequent payments shall be made on evidence of continued enrollment and attendance at the participating school.</p>

              <p>If the participating school requires partial payment of tuition prior to the start of the academic year to reserve space for students admitted to the school, that partial payment may be paid by the department prior to the first quarterly payment of the year in which the scholarship is awarded, up to a maximum of $1,000.00, and deducted from subsequent scholarship payments. If a student decides not to attend the participating school, the partial reservation payment must be returned to the department by such school. Only one reservation payment per student may be made per year.

            <p>§ 20-3-159. Use of bond proceeds; additional bonds
The proceeds of revenue bonds issued under this article shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or combined project and shall be disbursed upon requisition or order of the chairman of the authority under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture mentioned in Code Section 20-3-164 may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or combined project, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to cover the amount of such deficit. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, such additional bonds shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority, as the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund provided in Code Section 20-3-166 for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds.

          <content>
            <p>§ 20-3-164. Trust indentures to secure bonds; contents of indentures or bond resolutions; expenses of carrying out indentures
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign rents, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

The authority shall in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply them to the purposes of this article, subject to such regulations as this article and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.

(1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;

(2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;

(3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest; and

(4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in Code Section 20-3-154.

The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds; and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued.

            <p>§ 20-3-167. Remedies of bondholders, receivers, or indenture trustees
Any holder of revenue bonds or interest coupons issued under this article, any receiver for such holders, or indenture trustee, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this Code section may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may by action, mandamus, or other proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of this state or granted under this article or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this article or by resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, rents, and other charges for the use of the project or projects, and, in the event of default of the authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any revenue bond issue, shall be subrogated to each and every right, specifically including the contract rights of collecting rental, which the authority may possess, against the board of regents or other contracting or leasing department, agency, or institution of the state. In the pursuit of his or its remedies as subrogee, such individual, receiver, or trustee may proceed by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceedings due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged directly or indirectly to the benefit of the revenue bond issue of which such individual, receiver, or trustee is representative. No holder of any such bond or receiver or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state; nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state; provided, however, any provision of this article or any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding, any such bondholder or receiver or indenture trustee shall have the right by appropriate legal or equitable proceedings, including, without being limited to, mandamus, to enforce compliance by the appropriate public officials with Article VII, Section IV, Paragraph III of the Constitution of Georgia; and permission is given for the institution of any such proceedings to compel the payment of lease obligations.

            <p>§ 20-3-202. Creation; membership; officers; compensation of members; expenses of members; organization; duration; quorum
There is created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the Private Colleges and Universities Authority, and by that name, style, and title such body may contract and be contracted with, bring and defend actions and implead and be impleaded, and complain and defend in all courts of law and equity. Such authority, however, shall not be a state institution nor a department or agency of the state but shall be an instrumentality of purely public charity performing an essential governmental function, being a distinct corporate entity. Article VII, Section IV, Paragraph VII of the Constitution of Georgia and Article 2 of Chapter 17 of Title 50, the "Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission Act," shall not apply to the authority created in this Code section. The authority shall consist of five members appointed by the Governor. Two of the members appointed in 1978 shall be appointed for a term expiring January 1, 1980; two shall be appointed for a term expiring January 1, 1982; and one shall be appointed for a term expiring January 1, 1984. Thereafter, each member shall be appointed for a six-year term. The Governor shall fill the unexpired term of any member so appointed who shall cease to serve. All members appointed shall serve until their successors are appointed and qualified and any member may be reappointed. Immediately after each such appointment, such member of the authority shall enter upon his duties. The authority shall elect one of its members as chairman and another as vice-chairman and shall appoint a secretary, who need not be a member of the authority. The members of the authority may be compensated in an amount not to exceed the per diem amount paid to the members of the General Assembly under applicable Georgia law as in effect from time to time, plus actual expenses incurred, from the funds available to pay the administrative costs and expenses incurred by the authority, for each day's service spent in the performance of the duties of the authority. The authority may make rules and regulations for its own government, including, but not limited to, the payment of compensation to its members. The authority shall have perpetual existence. At all meetings of the authority the presence in person of a majority of the members in office shall be necessary for the transaction of business, and the affirmative vote of a majority of the members then in office shall be necessary for any action of the authority.

              <p>The authority is authorized from time to time to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as defined in Code Section 20-3-202 of any of its projects. Such bonds may also be issued to pay off, refund, or refinance any outstanding bonds or other obligations of any nature owed by the authority, whether or not such revenue bonds or other obligations shall then be subject to redemption, and the authority may provide for such arrangements as it may determine for the payment and security of the revenue bonds being issued or for the payment and security of the revenue bonds or other obligations to be paid off, refunded, or refinanced. The principal, premium, if any, and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the revenues, receipts, and earnings to be received by the authority in connection with the lease, sale, financing arrangement, or other disposition of the project for which the revenue bonds were issued. All revenue bonds issued by the authority are declared to be negotiable for all purposes, notwithstanding their payment from a limited source and without regard to any other law or laws. The authority may limit the negotiability of its obligations by issuing them in nonnegotiable or registered form or by providing for future registration under such terms and conditions as it may choose.</p>

              <p>All revenue bonds issued by the authority shall be subject to validation in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36, the "Revenue Bond Law" of the State of Georgia. All proceedings to validate revenue bonds of the authority shall be held in the Superior Court of Fulton County and judgments of validation obtained in the manner set forth in such chapter shall be forever conclusive upon the validity of such bonds and the security for such bonds as therein provided. The petition and complaint for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any participating institution for higher education which has contracted with the authority in connection with the issuance of the bonds or regarding the manner in which such bonds are to be secured; and such participating institution for higher education shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such security and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court, the validity of the terms thereof determined, and the security adjudicated as a binding obligation of the participating institution for higher education for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds against the authority issuing the same, any parties to the validation proceedings, or any persons who might properly have become parties to said proceedings. The certificate of validation, however, may be signed with the facsimile or manually executed official signature of the clerk or deputy clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County.</p>

The second alternative shall provide that the number of credit hours of higher education a qualified beneficiary may receive under the contract will be reduced to a percentage of the credit hours required for the granting of a baccalaureate degree at a state institution of higher education, as specified in the contract, if the qualified beneficiary enrolls in a state institution of higher education imposing at the time the qualified beneficiary enrolls an annual tuition rate that is greater than 105 percent of the weighted average annual tuition rate of all state institutions of higher education. This subsection shall not preclude a state institution of higher education at which a qualified beneficiary is entitled to receive less than the minimum number of credit hours required for the granting of a baccalaureate degree from providing that qualified beneficiary, without further tuition charges, the additional credit hours necessary to receive a baccalaureate degree.</p>

            <p>§ 20-4-2. Duties of State Board of Education in obtaining matching state and local funds
In matching the federal appropriations referred to in Code Section 20-4-1, the State Board of Education is directed to take advantage of whatever appropriations the state makes to schools and the teacher training department of the University of Georgia in order to secure these funds under the regulations provided by the secretary of education and also to take advantage, when permitted by the secretary of education, of any appropriations made by any municipality or county to any school of vocational character. To make up any deficiencies that may occur, the state board is authorized to use each year, so far as may be necessary, an amount equal to one-half of the federal appropriation from any funds not otherwise appropriated in the state treasury. So far as possible, the state board shall encourage municipal and county educational boards to meet the conditions and secure advantages of this federal appropriation.

The following compact, as amended, is approved and this state is declared to be a party thereto; and agreements, covenants, and obligations therein are binding upon the State of Georgia:
"THE REGIONAL COMPACT

(as amended) 

Whereas, The States who are parties hereto have during the past several years conducted careful investigation looking toward the establishment and maintenance of jointly owned and operated regional educational institutions in the Southern States in the professional, technological, scientific, literary and other fields, so as to provide greater educational advantages and facilities for the citizens of the several States who reside within such region; and

Whereas, Meharry Medical College of Nashville, Tennessee, has proposed that its lands, buildings, equipment, and the net income from its endowment be turned over to the Southern States, or to an agency acting in their behalf, to be operated as a regional institution for medical, dental and nursing education upon terms and conditions to be hereafter agreed upon between the Southern States and Meharry Medical College, which proposal, because of the present financial condition of the institution, has been approved by the said States who are parties hereto; and

Whereas, The said States desire to enter into a compact with each other providing for the planning and establishment of regional educational facilities;

Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and obligations assumed by the respective States who are parties hereto (hereinafter referred to as 'States'), the said several States do hereby form a geographical district or region consisting of the areas lying within the boundaries of the contracting States which, for the purposes of this compact, shall constitute an area for regional education supported by public funds derived from taxation by the constituent States and derived from other sources for the establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of regional educational schools and institutions for the benefit of citizens of the respective States residing within the region so established as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of this compact.

The States do further hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the Board of Control for Southern Regional Education (hereinafter referred to as the 'Board'), the members of which Board shall consist of the Governor of each State, ex officio, and four additional citizens of each State to be appointed by the Governor thereof, at least one of whom shall be selected from the field of education, and at least one of whom shall be a member of the legislature of that State. The Governor shall continue as a member of the Board during his tenure of office as Governor of the State, but the members of the Board appointed by the Governor shall hold office for a period of four years except that in the original appointments one Board member so appointed by the Governor shall be designated at the time of his appointment to serve an initial term of two years, one Board member to serve an initial term of three years, and the remaining Board member to serve the full term of four years, but thereafter the successor of each appointed Board member shall serve the full term of four years. Vacancies on the Board caused by death, resignation, refusal or inability to serve, shall be filled by appointment, by the Governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The officers of the Board shall be a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and such additional officers as may be created by the Board from time to time.

              <p>The Education Commission of the States, hereinafter called the "Commission", is hereby established. The Commission shall consist of seven members representing each party State. One of such members shall be the Governor; two shall be members of the State legislature selected by its respective houses and serving in such manner as the legislature may determine; and four shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Governor, unless the laws of the State otherwise provide. If the laws of a State prevent legislators from serving on the Commission, six members shall be appointed and serve at the pleasure of the Governor, unless the laws of the State otherwise provide. In addition to any other principles or requirements which a State may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the Commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the Commission for each party State shall be that the members representing such State shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge or affiliations be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the State government, higher education, the State education system, local education, lay and professional, public and nonpublic educational leadership. Of those appointees, one shall be the head of a State agency or institution, designated by the Governor, having responsibility for one or more programs of public education. In addition to the members of the Commission representing the party States, there may be not to exceed ten nonvoting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one year. Such commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or persons concerned with educational administration.</p>
