   "I, A.B., appointed pilot for the port and harbor of _____________, do swear that I will faithfully, according to the best of my ability, perform the duties of a pilot in and for the port and harbor of ____________, and will at all times - wind, weather, and health permitting - use my best efforts to go on board every vessel I shall see and conceive to be bound for, coming into, going out of, or underway within said port or harbor, unless I am well assured there is some other licensed pilot on board the same; that I will, at all times, make the best dispatch in my power to convey any vessel committed to my charge coming into, going out of, or underway within said port or harbor; and will at all times well and truly observe, fulfill, and follow, to the best of my skill and judgment, all such orders and directions as I may receive from the commissioners in all matters and things relating to the duty of a pilot."</p>
