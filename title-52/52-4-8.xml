Further, the canal companies shall pay reasonable compensation to such landholders as may have riparian rights in any stream or body of water taken, diverted, or obstructed for such taking, diversion, or obstruction or for any damage done them. The canal companies may also enter upon, take, and appropriate any lands and tenements necessary and appropriate for the purposes of the corporation upon first paying reasonable compensation therefor. No company incorporated as provided in this chapter shall have power to construct or use any canal within the corporate limits of any incorporated municipality without first obtaining the consent of the proper corporate authorities of such municipality.</p>
