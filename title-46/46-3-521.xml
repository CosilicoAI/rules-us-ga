          <p>The Secretary of State may propound to any electric membership corporation or foreign electric cooperative subject to this article, and to any officer or director thereof, such interrogatories as may be reasonably necessary and proper to enable him to ascertain whether such electric membership corporation or foreign electric cooperative had complied with all of the provisions of this article applicable to such electric membership corporation or foreign electric cooperative. Such interrogatories shall be answered within 30 days after the mailing thereof or within such additional time as shall be fixed by the Secretary of State; and the answers thereto shall be full and complete and shall be made in writing and under oath. If such interrogatories are directed to an individual, they shall be answered by him; and, if directed to an electric membership corporation or foreign electric cooperative, they shall be answered by the president, a vice-president, secretary, an assistant secretary, treasurer, or an assistant treasurer thereof. The Secretary of State need not file any document to which such interrogatories relate until such interrogatories are answered as provided in this Code section and not then if the answers thereto disclose that such document is not in conformity with this article. The Secretary of State shall certify to the Attorney General, for such action as the Attorney General may deem appropriate, all interrogatories and answers thereto which disclose a violation of any of the provisions of this article.</p>
          <p>(Code 1933, § 34C-1501, enacted by Ga. L. 1981, p. 1587, § 1.)</p>
