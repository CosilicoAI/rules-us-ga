          <p>Upon the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of an electric membership corporation, the portion of the assets distributable to a creditor or member who is unknown or cannot be found, or who is under disability and has no known representative legally competent to receive such distributive portion, shall be reduced to cash and deposited with the Office of the State Treasurer and shall be paid over to such creditor or member or to his legal representative upon proof satisfactory to the Office of the State Treasurer of his right thereto. After the Office of the State Treasurer has held the unclaimed cash for six months, the Office of the State Treasurer shall pay such cash to the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, to be held without liability for profit or interest until a claim for such cash shall be filed with the Office of the State Treasurer by the parties entitled thereto. No such claim shall be made more than six years after such cash is deposited with the Office of the State Treasurer.</p>
