Upon approval, the application and approval shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court of that county and with the Secretary of State and shall be published in the same manner as an application for incorporation. The application, together with the approval of the judge thereon, shall also be filed with the clerk of the superior court of each county in which the principal office of the cooperative has previously been located. The fees to be paid at the time of such filing shall be as prescribed in Code Section 46-5-100.</p>
