A professional association may render professional service only through officers, employees, and agents who are themselves duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render professional service within this state. The term "employee" as used in this Code section does not include clerks, bookkeepers, technicians, nurses, or other individuals who are not usually and ordinarily considered by custom and practice to be rendering professional services for which a license or other legal authorization is required in connection with the profession practiced by a particular professional association; nor does the term "employee" include any other person who performs all his employment under the direct supervision and control of an officer, agent, or employee who is himself rendering professional service to the public on behalf of the professional association; but no person shall, under the guise of employment, practice a profession unless duly licensed to practice that profession under the laws of this state.

Unless the articles of association expressly provide otherwise, a professional association shall continue as a separate entity independent of its members or shareholders, for all purposes for such period of time as provided in the articles, or until dissolved by a vote of two-thirds of the members. An association shall continue notwithstanding the death, insanity, incompetency, conviction for felony, resignation, withdrawal, transfer of membership or ownership of shares, retirement, or expulsion of any one or more of the members or shareholders; the admission of or transfer of membership or shares to any new member or members or shareholder or shareholders; or the happening of any other event, which under the law of this state and under like circumstances would work a dissolution of a partnership, it being the aim and intention of this Code section that such professional association shall have continuity of life independent of the life or status of its members or shareholders. No member or shareholder of a professional association shall have the power to dissolve the association by his independent act of any kind.

          <content>
            <p>§ 14-10-11. Severance of connection with association required upon legal disqualification of member to render professional service; effect of failure to comply
If any member, shareholder, agent, or employee of a professional association becomes legally disqualified to render a professional service within this state or accepts employment or is elected to a public office which, pursuant to existing law, is a restriction or limitation upon the rendering of professional service, he shall sever all employment with, or financial interest in, such professional association forthwith. A professional association's failure to comply or require compliance with this requirement shall be a ground for the forfeiture of its right to render professional service as a professional association pursuant to this chapter.

            <p>§ 14-10-12. Valuation of membership or shares of deceased, retired, expelled, or disqualified member or shareholder
If the articles of association or bylaws of a professional association fail to fix a price at which a professional association or its members or shareholders may purchase the membership or shares of a deceased, retired, expelled, or disqualified member or shareholder, and if the articles of association or bylaws do not otherwise provide, then the price for such membership or shares shall be the book value of such membership or shares at the end of the month immediately preceding the death or disqualification of the member or shareholder. Book value shall be determined by an independent certified public accountant employed for such purpose from the books and records of the professional association by the regular method of accounting employed by the professional association. The determination by the certified public accountant of book values shall be conclusive on the professional association and its members or shareholders.

A professional association organized pursuant to this chapter may contract in its own name, take, hold, and sell real and personal property in its own name, independent of its members, and sue and be sued as an independent entity as provided by law.

            <p>§ 14-11-309. Action without meetingExcept as otherwise provided in the articles of organization or a written operating agreement:
(1)  Action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken by members or managers may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the members or managers entitled to vote on the action or, if so provided in the articles of organization or a written operating agreement, by persons who would be entitled to vote not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action. The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by members or managers entitled to take such action, and delivered to the limited liability company for inclusion in its records;

(2)  If not otherwise fixed under the articles of organization or a written operating agreement, the record date for determining members or managers entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first member or manager signs the consent;

(3)  A consent signed under this Code section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document; and

(4)  If action is taken under this Code section by less than all of the members or managers entitled to vote on the action, all members or managers entitled to vote on the action who did not participate in taking the action shall be given written notice of the action not more than ten days after the taking of the action without a meeting, but the failure to give such notice shall not invalidate the action so taken.

This chapter does not alter any law applicable to the relationship between a person rendering professional services and a person receiving those services, including liability arising out of those professional services. This chapter does not alter any law with respect to disregarding legal entities. The failure of a limited liability company to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or the management of its business and affairs is not a ground for imposing personal liability on a member, manager, agent, or employee of the limited liability company for liabilities of the limited liability company.

(4)  Until the assignee of a limited liability company interest becomes a member, the assignor continues to be a member with respect to the assigned limited liability company interest, subject to the other members' right to remove the assignor pursuant to subparagraph (b)(3)(B) of Code Section 14-11-601 or subparagraph (b)(2)(B) of Code Section 14-11-601.1;

(5)  Until the assignee of a limited liability company interest becomes a member, the assignee shall have no liability as a member solely as a result of the assignment;

(6)  A member who assigns his or her entire limited liability company interest ceases to be a member or to have the power to exercise any rights of a member when all of the assignees of his or her entire limited liability company interest become members with respect to the assigned limited liability company interest, subject to the other members' right to remove the assignor earlier pursuant to subparagraph (b)(3)(B) of Code Section 14-11-601 or subparagraph (b)(2)(B) of Code Section 14-11-601.1; and

(7)  The pledge of, or granting of a security interest, lien, or other encumbrance in or against, any or all of the limited liability company interest of a member is not an assignment and shall not cause the member to cease to be a member or to cease to have the power to exercise any rights or powers of a member.

(C)  Either be executed by the registered agent or a member or manager of the limited liability company, in each case as set forth in the most recent annual registration of the limited liability company filed with the Secretary of State, or be accompanied by a notarized statement, executed by a person who was a member or manager, or an heir, successor, or assign of a person who was a member or manager, of the limited liability company at the time that the limited liability company was administratively dissolved, stating that such person or decedent was a member or manager of the limited liability company at the time of administrative dissolution and such person has knowledge of and assents to the application for reinstatement;

(D)  Contain a statement by the limited liability company reciting that all taxes owed by the limited liability company have been paid; and(E)  Be accompanied by the fee required for the application for reinstatement contained in Code Section 14-11-1101.

              <p>Except as otherwise provided in the articles of organization or a written operating agreement, upon dissolution, the members or managers in whom management of the limited liability company was vested prior to dissolution may wind up a dissolved limited liability company's affairs, or, if there are no such members or managers at the time of or at any time after such dissolution, such persons as may be designated by the persons then entitled to receive a majority of all subsequent distributions, if any, from the limited liability company may wind up the limited liability company's affairs. For cause shown, the court may wind up a dissolved limited liability company's affairs on application of any member as to which an event of dissociation has not occurred, any such member's legal representative, or any such member's assignee, or if there is no such member, legal representative, or assignee, on application of any assignee of an interest in the limited liability company.</p>

Every church or religious society is authorized to fill all vacancies which may arise in the administration of the trusts described in Code Section 14-5-46 by the death, removal, or expulsion of a trustee or otherwise.

The articles shall state that the purpose of the corporation is to practice the profession named in the articles and that the corporation elects to be governed by this chapter. Any corporation organized under the general corporation laws of this state or any professional association organized under Chapter 10 of this title may elect to be governed by this chapter by amending its articles of association so as to make such election and so as to comply with the other requirements of this chapter and with the laws applicable to corporations generally in this state which are not inconsistent with the express provisions of this chapter. A professional corporation and the shareholders of the corporation in their capacity as shareholders shall enjoy the rights, privileges, and immunities and shall be subject to the obligations and liabilities of other corporations organized for profit under Chapter 2 of this title and those of the shareholders of such corporations, except as changed, restricted, or enlarged by this chapter. Professional associations organized under Chapter 10 of this title are expressly authorized to continue to perform professional services pursuant to that Chapter 10 of this title without electing to comply with this chapter.

            <p>§ 14-8-7. Determination of existence of partnershipIn determining whether a partnership exists, the following rules shall apply:
(1)  Except as provided by Code Section 14-8-16 persons who are not partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons;

(2)  Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership, whether such co-owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property;

(3)  The sharing of gross returns does not of itself establish a partnership, whether or not the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in any property from which the returns are derived;(4)  The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima-facie evidence that he is a partner in the business; provided, however, that no such inference shall be drawn if profits were received in payment of the following, even though the amount of payment varies with the profits of the business:
(A)  A debt, whether by installments or otherwise;

(B)  Wages, salary, or other compensation to an employee or independent contractor;

(C)  Rent to a landlord;

(D)  An annuity or other payment to a surviving spouse or representative of a deceased partner;

(E)  Interest or other payment or charge on a loan;

(F)  Consideration for the sale of good will of a business or other property, whether by installments or otherwise.

            <p>§ 14-8-9. Agency of partners for partnershipSubject to the provisions of Code Section 14-8-10.1:
(1)  Every partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business, and the act of every partner, including the execution in the partnership name of any instrument, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership of which he is a member binds the partnership, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing has knowledge of the fact that he has no such authority;

(2)  An act of a partner which is not apparently for the carrying on of the business of the partnership in the usual way does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the other partners in the partnership agreement, at the time of the transaction or at any other time;(3)  Unless authorized by the other partners or unless they have abandoned the business, one or more but less than all the partners have no authority to:
(A)  Assign the partnership property in trust for creditors or on the assignee's promise to pay the debts of the partnership;

(B)  Dispose of the good will of the business;

(C)  Do any other act which would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of a partnership;

(D)  Confess a judgment;

(E)  Submit a partnership claim or liability to arbitration or reference;

(4)  No act of a partner in contravention of a restriction on authority shall bind the partnership to persons having knowledge of the restriction.

              <p>When a person has been thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons not actual partners, he is an agent of the persons consenting to such representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as though he were a partner in fact, with respect to persons who rely upon the representation. Where all the members of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results; but in all other cases it is the joint act or obligation of the person acting and the persons consenting to the representation.

Subject to any contrary agreement among the partners, an amendment to become a limited liability partnership by an existing limited partnership shall be approved by all of the partners. A limited partnership becomes a limited liability partnership at the time its certificate which complies with the foregoing provisions of this subsection becomes effective and continues to be a limited liability partnership until its certificate of limited partnership is amended to remove the statement that such limited partnership is a limited liability partnership and so that its name no longer contains the words "limited liability limited partnership," or the abbreviation "L.L.L.P.," or the designation "LLLP." The fact that the certificate of limited partnership of a limited partnership has been amended as set forth in this subsection is notice that the limited partnership is a limited liability partnership. If a limited partnership that is a limited liability partnership is dissolved and its business continued without liquidation of the limited partnership's affairs, the new limited partnership shall continue to be a limited liability partnership until its certificate of limited partnership is amended as provided in this subsection. A limited partnership that becomes a limited liability partnership pursuant to this subsection shall otherwise remain subject to Chapter 9 of this title, including, without limitation, the annual registration provisions of Code Section 14-9-206.5.

              <p>A person may apply to reserve a name for the purpose of forming a limited partnership by paying the fee specified in Code Section 14-9-1101.

If the Secretary of State finds that the name applied for is not distinguishable for filing purposes upon the records of the Secretary of State, he or she shall notify the applicant who may then submit another reservation request within ten days of the date of the rejection notice without payment of an additional reservation fee.</p>

A limited partner may maintain an action in the right of a limited partnership to recover a judgment in its favor if general partners with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or an effort to cause those general partners to bring the action is not likely to succeed. The foregoing authority to bring an action in the right of a limited partnership shall not limit any right a limited partner might have under the partnership agreement or otherwise.
