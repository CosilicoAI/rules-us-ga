Since the public safety requires, and the advantages of uniform regulation make it desirable in the interest of aeronautical progress, that aircraft operating within the state should conform, with respect to design, construction, and airworthiness, to the standards prescribed by the federal government with respect to navigation of civil aircraft subject to its jurisdiction, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate or navigate any aircraft unless such aircraft has an appropriate effective license issued by the Federal Aviation Administration and is registered by the Federal Aviation Administration; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to military aircraft of the United States or possessions thereof, to public aircraft of any state or territory, or to aircraft licensed by a foreign country with which the United States has a reciprocal agreement covering the operation of such licensed aircraft.

Private property needed by a county, municipality, or other political subdivision for an airport or landing field or for the expansion of an airport or landing field may be acquired by grant, purchase, lease, or other means, if such county, municipality, or other political subdivision is able to agree with the owners of the property on the terms of such acquisition, and otherwise by condemnation in the manner provided by the law under which the county, municipality, or other political subdivision is authorized to acquire real property for public purposes; provided, however, that the power of condemnation may be exercised extraterritorially only with the consent of the governing authority of the county, municipality, or other political subdivision wherein the property is located, as expressed either in a resolution adopted by such governing authority, granting its consent to such condemnation, or by failure of such governing authority to adopt a resolution denying its consent to such condemnation within 60 days from the receipt of a resolution from the proposed condemnor requesting approval of such condemnation, or with the consent of the General Assembly, as expressed in a resolution enacted by the General Assembly, after denial of consent to such condemnation by the governing authority of the county, municipality, or other political subdivision wherein the property is located; provided, however, that for any proposed airport or airport expansion by a city into a county where such city is located, or by a county into a city located in such county, the decision of the governing body of the jurisdiction into which such proposed airport or airport expansion is to be located shall be final as to whether or not such power of condemnation may be exercised extraterritorially.

          <content>
            <p>§ 6-4-8. Requirements for issuance of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations
Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by an authority shall be paid solely from the property, including, but not limited to, real property, fixtures, personal property, revenues, or other funds pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered to secure or to pay such bonds, notes, or other obligations.  All revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the authority, adopted by a majority vote of the members of the authority at a regular or special meeting. Such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times not more than 40 years from their respective dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time, shall be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide.  The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the members of the authority then in office and their successors. The authority shall have the power from time to time and whenever it deems refunding expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and may issue partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this chapter.  The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.  There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which the authority may issue. Any limitations with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in the usury laws of the State of Georgia, or any other laws of the State of Georgia, shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority.
