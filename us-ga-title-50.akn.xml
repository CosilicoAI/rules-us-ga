              <p>The decision as to whether to accept credit card payments for any particular type of payment shall be made by the officer or board or other body having general discretionary authority over the manner of acceptance of such type of payments. If credit card payments are to be accepted, such officer or board or other body shall be authorized to adopt reasonable policies, rules, or regulations not in conflict with this Code section governing the manner of acceptance of credit card payments. However, no credit card payments shall be accepted for local ad valorem taxes without the formal agreement of the governing authority of the political subdivision for whose benefit such taxes are collected, and no credit card payments shall be accepted for any state taxes or fees without formal approval by the State Depository Board. The officer or board or other body having the general discretionary authority over the manner of acceptance of such payments shall be authorized to enter into appropriate agreements with credit card issuers or other appropriate parties as needed to facilitate the acceptance of credit card payments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such agreements may provide for the acceptance of credit card payments at a discount from their face amount or the payment or withholding of administrative fees from the face amount of such payments. Such discount or administrative fees may be authorized when the officer or board or other body determines that any reduction of revenue resulting from such discount or fees will be in the best interest of state or local government. Factors which may be considered in making such a determination may include but are not necessarily limited to improved governmental cash flow, reduction of governmental overhead, improved governmental financial security, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing together with the benefit of increased public convenience.

          <content>
            <p>§ 50-12-130. Creation of Georgia Commission on the HolocaustThe General Assembly finds and declares that:
(1)  During the period from 1933 through 1945, six million Jews and millions of other Europeans were murdered in Nazi concentration camps as part of a carefully orchestrated program of cultural, social, and political genocide known as the Holocaust;

(2)  All people should remember the horrible atrocities committed at that time and other times in human history as the result of bigotry and tyranny and, therefore, should continually rededicate themselves to the principles of human rights and equal protection under the laws of a democratic society;

(3)  It is desirable to educate our citizens about the events leading up to the Holocaust and about the organizations and facilities that were created and used purposefully for the systematic destruction of human beings;

(4)  Holocaust history is the proper concern of all people, particularly students enrolled in the schools, colleges, and universities of the State of Georgia;

(5)  Programs, workshops, institutes, seminars, exhibits, and other teacher-training activities for the study of the Holocaust have taken place during recent years at various middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities in this state; and

(6)  It is desirable to create a permanent state commission which, as an organized body and on a continuous basis, will survey, design, encourage, and promote implementation of Holocaust education and awareness programs in Georgia and will be responsible for organizing and promoting the memorialization of the Holocaust on a regular basis throughout the state.

            <p>§ 50-13-4.1. Agency reporting on required regulation
Each agency shall prepare annually a report that specifies with detail those federal government mandates that require agency promulgation of rules and regulations rather than enactment of law by the General Assembly. Such report shall also identify state and federal regulatory duplication. A copy of such report shall be submitted to the Governor, Secretary of State, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Secretary of the Senate, Clerk of the House of Representatives, and legislative counsel.

(1)  Upon timely application, any person shall be permitted to intervene when a statute confers an unconditional right to intervene or when the representation of an applicant's interest is or may be inadequate; or

(2)  Upon timely application, any person may be permitted to intervene when a statute confers a conditional right to intervene or when the applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising its discretion, the agency shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of existing parties.

          <content>
            <p>§ 50-13-15. Rules of evidence in contested cases; official notice; conducting hearings by utilizing remote telephonic communicationsIn contested cases:
(1)  Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. The rules of evidence as applied in the trial of civil nonjury cases in the superior courts shall be followed. When necessary to ascertain facts not reasonably susceptible of proof under such rules, evidence not admissible thereunder may be admitted, except where precluded by statute, if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of their affairs or if it consists of a report of medical, psychiatric, or psychological evaluation of a type routinely submitted to and relied upon by an agency in the normal course of its business. Agencies shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, when a hearing will be expedited and the interest of the parties will not be prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be received in written form;

(2)  Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts if the original is not readily available. Upon request, parties shall be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original or have it established as documentary evidence according to the rules of evidence applicable to the superior courts of this state;

(3)  A party may conduct such cross-examination as shall be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts;

(4)  Official notice may be taken of judicially cognizable facts. In addition, official notice may be taken of generally recognized technical or scientific facts within the agency's specialized knowledge. Parties shall be notified either before or during the hearing, by reference in preliminary reports or otherwise, of the material noticed, including any staff memoranda or data, and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed. The agency's experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of the evidence; and

(5)  Any hearing which is required or permitted hereunder may be conducted by utilizing remote telephonic communications if the record reflects that all parties have consented to the conduct of the hearing by use of such communications and that such procedure will not jeopardize the rights of any party to the hearing.

            <p>§ 50-13-16. Proposal for decision in contested cases; opportunity to file exceptions and present briefs and arguments
When in a contested case a majority of the officials of the agency who are to render the final decision have not heard the case or read the record, the decision, if adverse to a party to the proceeding other than the agency itself, shall not be made until a proposal for decision is served upon the parties and an opportunity is afforded to each party adversely affected to file exceptions and present briefs and oral argument to the officials who are to render the decision. The proposal for decision shall contain a statement of the reasons therefor and of each issue of fact or law necessary to the proposed decision, prepared by the person who conducted the hearing or one who has read the record. The parties by written stipulation may waive compliance with this Code section.

              <p>In contested cases in which the agency has not presided at the reception of the evidence, the agency representative who presided shall initially decide the case or the agency shall require the entire record before the agency representative to be certified to it for initial decision. When the representative makes the initial decision, and in absence of an application to the agency within 30 days from the date of notice of the initial decision for review, or an order by the agency within such time for review on its motion, the initial decision shall, without further proceedings, become the decision of the agency. On review from the initial decision of the representative, the agency shall have all the powers it would have in making the initial decision and, if deemed advisable, the agency may take additional testimony or remand the case to the hearing representative for such purpose. When the agency makes the initial decision without having presided at the reception of evidence, the agency representative shall first recommend a decision, a copy of which shall be sent to each party and which shall be made a part of the record.</p>

                <p>Once an agency has furnished exculpatory, favorable, or arguably favorable information, has indicated that no such information exists, or has refused to furnish such information, the licensee may request a prehearing in camera inspection of the remainder of the investigative file by the person or persons presiding over the hearing.  Such person or persons shall furnish the licensee with all material that would aid in the licensee's defense that is exculpatory, favorable, or arguably favorable.  Such person or persons shall seal a copy of the entire investigative file in order to preserve it in the event of an appeal.

              <p>Any person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this chapter. This Code section does not limit utilization of or the scope of judicial review available under other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de novo provided by law. A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy.</p>

              <p>Proceedings for review are instituted by filing a petition within 30 days after the service of the final decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within 30 days after the decision thereon. The petition may be filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county of residence of the petitioner; or, if the petitioner is a corporation, the appeal may be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County or in the superior court of the county where the petitioner maintains its principal place of doing business in this state; and provided, further, that all proceedings for review with respect to orders, rules, regulations, or other decisions or directives of the Commissioner of Agriculture may also be brought in the Superior Court of Tift County or the Superior Court of Chatham County. All proceedings for review, however, with respect to orders, rules, regulations, or other decisions or directives of the Public Service Commission must be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record. The petition shall state the nature of the petitioner's interest, the fact showing that the petitioner is aggrieved by the decision, and the ground as specified in subsection</p>

            <p>§ 50-13-20. Review of final judgment
An aggrieved party may obtain a review of any final judgment of the superior court under this chapter by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as provided by law. In contested cases involving a license to practice medicine or a license to practice dentistry in this state, the filing of an application for appeal or a notice of appeal shall not by itself stay enforcement of the agency decision. In such cases, the superior court which considered the petition for judicial review or the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court may order a stay only if such court makes a finding that the public health, safety, and welfare will not be harmed by the issuance of the stay.

            <p>§ 50-15-2. Petition by political subdivision for posting of bond by opposing party or intervenor; hearing; dismissal upon failure to file bond; appeal
At any time prior to the final determination of a public lawsuit in the trial court or on appeal, any political subdivision which is a party to the action may petition for an order of the court that the opposing party or parties or intervenors be dismissed unless such opposing party or parties or intervenors post a bond with surety to be approved by the court payable to the moving party for the payment of all damages and costs which may accrue by reason of such opposition or intervention in the event the moving party prevails. The moving party shall obtain from a judge of the court an order requiring the opposing party or parties or intervenors to appear at such time and place within 20 days from the filing of the petition as the judge may direct and to show cause, if any exists, why the prayers of the petition should not be granted. The petition and order shall be served in the manner provided by law for the service of orders and pleadings subsequent to the original complaint. If, at the hearing of the petition on the order to show cause, the court determines that it is in the public interest to do so, the court shall set the amount of bond to be filed by the opposing party or parties or intervenors in an amount found by the court to cover all damage and costs which may accrue to the political subdivision by reason of the opposition or intervention in the event the political subdivision prevails. In the event the bond is not filed by the opposing party or parties or intervenors with surety approved by the court within ten days after the order is entered, the opposing party or parties or intervenors shall be dismissed by operation of law. Either the opposing party or parties or intervenors or the political subdivision may appeal the order under the procedure provided by law in cases of injunction. The appellate court may stay the lower court order pending its own decision, may set a bond to be filed by the opposing party or parties or intervenors in connection therewith, may modify the order of the lower court, or may enter its order as a final order in the case. In the event no bond is filed as provided in this Code section, the opposing party or parties or intervenors shall be dismissed by operation of law; and, upon final determination of the case, no court shall have further jurisdiction of any action involving any issue which was or could have been raised therein.

After a public lawsuit is commenced, no other action relating to the same subject matter shall be commenced, and no trial court shall have jurisdiction of any such subsequent action.

              <p>It is the intent of this Code section to implement the provisions of Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VI of the Constitution of the State of Georgia which generally prohibit gratuities by devising an administrative mechanism which will ensure that any obligation due the state is not pursued when it is manifest that the account is uncollectable or when the costs of pursuing a moderate indebtedness would create a greater obligation on the treasury than the amount claimed and that there will be an established procedure to scrutinize modest debts individually and, when collection appears to be unlikely, to make a formal administrative determination to conserve public moneys which would otherwise be expended for unfruitful collection efforts.</p>

Four members of the commission shall constitute a quorum. No vacancy on the commission shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the commission. With the sole exception of acquisitions of real property, which acquisitions shall require four affirmative votes of the membership of the commission present and voting at any meeting, the business, powers, and duties of the commission may be transacted, exercised, and performed by a majority vote of the commission members present and voting at a meeting when more than a quorum is present and voting or by a majority vote of a quorum when only a quorum is present and voting at a meeting. An abstention in voting shall be considered as that member not being present and not voting in the matter on which the vote is taken. No person may be appointed, elected, or serve on the commission who is a member of the legislative or judicial branch of government. In the event any ex officio member is determined to be in either the legislative or judicial branch of government, the General Assembly declares that it would have passed this article without such ex officio position on the commission and would have reduced the quorum and vote required of the commission on all actions accordingly.</p>

              <p>Notwithstanding any provisions and requirements of law to the contrary, the commission is authorized to negotiate, prepare, and enter into in its own name rental agreements whereby a part of the property is rented, without public competitive bidding, to a person for a length of time not to exceed one year and for adequate monetary consideration (in no instance to be less than a rate of $250.00 per year), which shall be determined by the commission, and pursuant to such terms and conditions as the commission shall determine to be in the best interest of the state. The same property or any part thereof shall not be the subject matter of more than one such rental agreement to the same person unless the commission shall determine that there are extenuating circumstances present which would make additional one-year rental agreements beneficial to the state; provided, however, the same property or any part thereof shall not after April 24, 1975, be the subject matter of more than a total of three such one-year rental agreements to the same person.</p>

              <p>The commission is given the authority and charged with the duty of managing the utilization of administrative space by all state entities, except that the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia may manage its own space but only for leases that are for a term of one year or less, within the State of Georgia, and required for its core mission. The commission shall manage the utilization of administrative space for all multiyear lease agreements entered into on behalf of any state entity, including the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. The commission shall manage in a manner that is the most cost efficient and operationally effective and which provides decentralization of state government. Such management shall include the authority to assign and reassign administrative space to state entities based on the needs of the entities as determined by standards for administrative space utilization promulgated by the commission pursuant to subsection</p>

              <p>The management of the utilization of administrative space by the commission shall include entering into any necessary agreements to rent or lease administrative space, whether existing or to be constructed, and shall include administrative space rented or leased by a state entity from the Georgia Building Authority or from any other public or private person, firm, or corporation. When it becomes necessary to rent or lease administrative space, the space shall be rented or leased by the commission for a term not to exceed 20 years. The space shall be assigned to the state entity or entities requiring the space. A multiyear lease resulting from a sale and lease back shall be treated as a conveyance of real property by the state and shall be reviewed for approval or disapproval by the General Assembly and Governor in the same manner as a conveyance of state properties provided for in Code Section 50-16-39.</p>

The commission may require the submission of such information by the Department of Transportation; the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia; and the State Properties Commission, acting for and on behalf of a state agency, and by the owner or representatives of the owner of the public property as the commission may reasonably require for the consideration of the application. If the commission determines that the acquisition of the public property by condemnation is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, it shall grant its approval for such acquisition. The determination of the commission shall be final. The commission shall make its determination within 30 days after the commission receives the information required by the commission for the consideration of the application of the state agency and in no event longer than 90 days after receipt of the application.

On or prior to the end of such fiscal year, the commission shall certify to the fiscal officer of the state the amount of the appropriation for any purpose which has been transferred to the sinking fund and the amount of the anticipated highest annual debt service requirement of debt authorized to be issued in such fiscal year for any purpose by resolution of the commission but which actually will be incurred in the next succeeding fiscal year. The remaining appropriation for any purpose, after deducting the aggregate amounts described in the preceding sentence, shall lapse, except that any such amount attributable to an appropriation to general obligation debt for the construction and improvement of public roads and bridges shall not lapse but shall be paid to the Department of Transportation. The General Assembly may provide in an appropriation of highest annual debt service requirements that if the commission determines not to incur the debt so authorized, the commission may expend the appropriation as capital outlay for the purposes specified in the appropriation. The appropriation as capital outlay shall lapse at the end of the fiscal year of the appropriation unless committed as provided by law. The appropriation as highest annual debt service shall expire as authorization for debt when the funds are committed as capital outlay but shall otherwise lapse as provided by law.</p>

                <p>Variable rate debt may be incurred in the following manner:
(A)  For purposes of calculating the highest annual debt service requirements for variable rate debt, interest may be calculated at the maximum rate of interest that may be payable during any one fiscal year, after taking into account any credits permitted in the related bond resolution, indenture, or other instrument against such amount;

(B)  Any resolution authorizing general obligation debt which is variable rate debt, in lieu of stating the rate or rates at which such variable rate debt shall bear interest and the price or prices at which such variable rate bonds shall be initially sold or remarketed, in the event of purchase and subsequent resale, may provide that such interest rates and prices may vary from time to time depending on criteria established in the approving resolution, which criteria may include, without limitation, references to indices or variations in interest rates as may, in the judgment of a remarketing agent, be necessary to cause variable rate debt to be remarketable from time to time at a price equal to its principal amount and may provide for the appointment of a bank, trust company, investment bank, or other financial institution to serve as remarketing agent for such purposes. The resolution for any variable rate debt may provide that alternate interest rates or provisions for establishing alternate interest rates, different security or claim priorities, or different call or amortization provisions will apply during such times as the variable rate debts are held by a person providing credit or liquidity enhancement arrangements for such debt as authorized in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. The resolution may also provide for such variable rate debt to bear interest at rates established pursuant to a process generally known as an auction rate process and may provide for appointment of one or more financial institutions or investment banks to serve as auction agents and bro</p>

General obligation debt may also be incurred to provide educational facilities for county and independent school systems and to provide public library facilities for county and independent school systems, counties, municipalities, and boards of trustees of public libraries or boards of trustees of public library systems. General obligation debt may also be incurred in order to make loans to counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, local authorities, and other local governmental entities for water or sewerage facilities or systems. It shall not be necessary for the state or a state authority to hold title to or otherwise be the owner of such facilities or systems. General obligation debt for these purposes may be authorized and incurred for administration and disbursement by a state authority created and activated before, on, or after November 8, 1960. Guaranteed revenue debt may be incurred by guaranteeing the payment of revenue obligations issued by an instrumentality of the state if such revenue obligations are issued to finance toll bridges, toll roads, or any other land public transportation facilities or systems, or water or sewage treatment facilities or systems, or to make or purchase, or lend or deposit against the security of, loans to citizens of the state for educational purposes; provided, however, that in no event shall general obligation debt or guaranteed revenue debt be incurred for water or sewage treatment facilities or systems for counties or municipalities unless such facilities are financed in whole or in part through an instrumentality of the state created by the General Assembly for the purpose of assisting the state, counties, or municipalities in the financing of water or sewage treatment facilities or systems for the benefit of the citizens of Georgia.

                <p>(A) All actions of the commission shall be taken by resolution. Each resolution adopted in connection with authorizing public debt shall be reduced to writing; and the executive secretary shall maintain a full and correct record of each step or proceeding had or taken in the course of authorizing and contracting public debt. Each authorizing resolution shall state each purpose of the debt it authorizes, which statement need not be more specific but shall not be more general than those purposes in or pursuant to law and the maximum principal amount authorized for each purpose. Public debt may be contracted and evidences of indebtedness issued therefor pursuant to one or more authorizing resolutions, unless otherwise provided in the resolution at any time and from time to time for any combination of purposes, in any specific amounts, at any rates of interest, for any term, payable at any intervals, at any place, in any manner, and having any other terms or conditions deemed by the commission to be necessary or useful. Unless debt is sooner incurred or unless a shorter period is provided in such resolution, every authorizing resolution shall expire one year after the date of its adoption if the debt authorized by such resolution has not been issued in whole or in part.
(B)  In the event it is determined by the commission that it is to the best interest of the state to fund or refund any such public debt or obligation, the same may be accomplished by resolution of the commission without any action on the part of the General Assembly. Any appropriation made or required to be made with respect to the debt being funded or refunded shall immediately attach and inure to the benefit of the obligations to be issued in connection with such funding or refunding, to the same extent and with the same effect as though the obligation to be issued had originally been authorized by action of the General Assembly, provided that the debt incurred in connection with any such funding or r</p>

The principal amount of any debt issued in connection with such funding or refunding may exceed the principal amount being funded or refunded to the extent necessary to provide for the payment of any premium thereby incurred.</p>

In the event any refund claim is approved and the taxpayer has not paid other state taxes which have become due, as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner may set off the unpaid taxes against the refund. When the setoff authorized in this Code section is exercised, the refund shall be deemed granted and the amount of the setoff shall be considered for all purposes as a payment toward the particular tax debt which is being set off. Any excess refund properly allowable under this paragraph which remains after the setoff has been applied may be refunded to the taxpayer.

          <content>
            <p>§ 50-17-52. Contracts for interest on deposits; authority to remove deposits
The board shall make with depositories the most advantageous contracts for interest to be paid by them to the state for the use of the state's money which may be deposited therein, as provided by this article. In so doing, the board may authorize the state treasurer to negotiate with depositories explicit fees in payment for the state's banking services.  Such fees shall be paid by the state treasurer from interest earned and shall be subject to the board's approval.  In the event any depository so named shall refuse to make a satisfactory contract with the board as to interest to be paid and fees to be charged, it shall have authority to remove state funds from such depository.

            <p>§ 50-17-54. Monitoring financial condition of depositories; action in case of insolvency of depository
It shall be the duty of the board to keep itself advised, from time to time, of the financial condition of the various state depositories, as well as of the financial condition and standing of the securities on the bonds of the depositories; and, if at any time the board should become satisfied as to the insolvency of any of the depositories or that the affairs of any of the depositories are in an embarrassed financial condition, it shall be the duty of the board to direct the state treasurer to withdraw the money of the state from such depository. In case the board should be advised of the insolvency of the securities on the bond of any of the depositories, it shall be the duty of the state treasurer to notify the depository to strengthen the bond; and if, at the end of ten days, the bond is not strengthened, it shall be the duty of the board to direct the state treasurer to withdraw the money of the state from such depository. In either event, the board may also withdraw designation as a state depository.

          <content>
            <p>§ 50-17-58. Execution of bonds by depositories
Depositories, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, by their proper officers, shall execute bonds, with good and sufficient securities, to be fixed and approved by the Governor. The bonds shall be conditioned for the faithful performance of all such duties as shall be required of them by law and for a faithful accounting for the money or effects that may come into their hands during their continuance in office. The bonds shall be filed and recorded in the Governor's office and copies thereof, certified by one of the Governor's secretaries under the seal of the executive department, shall be received in evidence in lieu of the original in any of the courts; and the bonds shall have the same binding force and effect as public officers' bonds and, in case of default, shall be enforced in like manner. In determining the amount of the bond to be given by a depository under this Code section, the Governor shall fix the same as to make it not less than the amount of money to be entrusted to the depository; and in no case shall a larger amount of money be deposited in any depository than the amount of the bond; and the Governor, at any time, may require additional bond, if necessary, to cover fully the amount deposited or intended to be deposited in such bank. The board, in its discretion, may waive the requirement of such bond as to demand deposits in a depository.

              <p>The reporter, prior to declaring the contract breached, shall seek the advice of a panel composed of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, an appointee of the Governor who is not the Attorney General, the executive counsel, and the legislative counsel. The publisher shall have an opportunity to appear before this panel to explain the reason for his failure to have in stock a particular volume and to avoid liability for any sum which may be assessed against him. The panel can decide to provide the publisher an extended period of time to produce the required volumes of reports, or it may declare the publisher liable for a sum assessed by the reporter; and, if the reporter has so requested, it may declare the contract with the publisher ended. In any case, the decision of the panel is final.

In those instances where some, but not all, records are available within three business days, an agency shall make available within that period those records that can be located and produced. In any instance where records are unavailable within three business days of receipt of the request, and responsive records exist, the agency shall, within such time period, provide the requester with a description of such records and a timeline for when the records will be available for inspection or copying and provide the responsive records or access thereto as soon as practicable.(B)  A request made pursuant to this article may be made to the custodian of a public record orally or in writing. An agency may, but shall not be obligated to, require that all written requests be made upon the responder's choice of one of the following: the agency's director, chairperson, or chief executive officer, however denominated; the senior official at any satellite office of an agency; a clerk specifically designated by an agency as the custodian of agency records; or a duly designated open records officer of an agency; provided, however, that the absence or unavailability of the designated agency officer or employee shall not be permitted to delay the agency's response. At the time of inspection, any person may make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of the records using suitable portable devices brought to the place of inspection.

Agencies shall produce electronic copies of or, if the requester prefers, printouts of electronic records or data from data base fields that the agency maintains using the computer programs that the agency has in its possession. An agency shall not refuse to produce such electronic records, data, or data fields on the grounds that exporting data or redaction of exempted information will require inputting range, search, filter, report parameters, or similar commands or instructions into an agency's computer system so long as such commands or instructions can be executed using existing computer programs that the agency uses in the ordinary course of business to access, support, or otherwise manage the records or data. A requester may request that electronic records, data, or data fields be produced in the format in which such data or electronic records are kept by the agency, or in a standard export format such as a flat file electronic American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format, if the agency's existing computer programs support such an export format.

            <p>§ 50-2-1. Boundaries of the state generally
The boundaries of Georgia, as deduced from the Constitution of Georgia, the Convention of Beaufort, the Articles of Cession and Agreement with the United States of America entered into on April 24, 1802, the Resolution of the General Assembly dated December 8, 1826, and the adjudications and compromises affecting Alabama, Florida, and South Carolina are as follows:
      From the sea, at the point where the northern edge of the navigable channel of the River Savannah intersects a point three geographical miles east of the ordinary low water mark, generally along the northern edge of the navigable channel up the River Savannah, along the northern edge of the sediment basin to the Tidegate, thence along the stream thereof to the fork or confluence made by the Rivers Keowee and Tugalo, and thence along said River Tugalo until the fork or confluence made by said Tugalo and the River Chattooga, and up and along the same to the point where it touches the northern boundary line of South Carolina, and the southern boundary line of North Carolina, which is at a point on the thirty-fifth parallel of north latitude, reserving all the islands in said Rivers Savannah, Tugalo, and Chattooga, except for the Barnwell Islands and Oyster Bed Island in the Savannah, to Georgia; thence on said line west, to a point where it merges into and becomes the northern boundary line of Alabama -- it being the point fixed by the survey of the State of Georgia, and known as Nickajack; thence in a direct line to the great bend of the Chattahoochee River, called Miller's Bend -- it being the line run and marked by said survey; and thence along and down the western bank of said Chattahoochee River, along the line or limit of high-water mark, to its junction with the Flint River; thence along a certain line of survey made by Gustavus J. Orr, a surveyor on the part of Georgia, and W. Whitner, a surveyor on the part of Florida, beginning at a fore-and-aft tree about four chains below the junction; thence along this line east, to a point designated 37 links north of Ellicott's Mound on the St. Marys River; thence along the middle of said river to the Atlantic Ocean, and extending therein three geographical miles from ordinary low water along those portions of the coast and coastal islands in direct contact with the open sea or three geographical miles from the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters; thence running in a northerly direction and following the direction of the Atlantic Coast to the point where the northern edge of the navigable channel of the River Savannah intersects a point three geographical miles east of the ordinary low water mark, the place of beginning; including all the lands, waters, islands, and jurisdictional rights within said limits; and also all the islands within three geographical miles of the seacoast.

            <p>§ 50-2-2. Boundary between Georgia and South Carolina
The boundary between Georgia and South Carolina shall be the line described as running from the mouth of the River Savannah, up said river and the Rivers Tugalo and Chattooga, to the point where the last-named river intersects with the thirty-fifth parallel of north latitude, conforming as much as possible to the line agreed on by the commissioners of said states at Beaufort on April 28, 1787, except for the Barnwell Islands and the Oyster Bed Island in the River Savannah; provided, however, that the boundary along the lower reaches of the Savannah River, and the lateral seaward boundary, shall be more particularly described as being:
      BEGINNING at a point 32 degrees 07 minutes 00 seconds North Latitude and 81 degrees 07 minutes 00 seconds West Longitude, located in the Savannah River, and proceeding in a southeasterly direction down the thread of the Savannah River equidistant between the banks of the River on Hutchinson Island and on the mainland of South Carolina, including the small downstream island southeast of the aforesaid point, at ordinary stage, until reaching the vicinity of Pennyworth Island;
      Proceeding thence easterly down the thread of the northernmost channel of the Savannah River as it flows north of Pennyworth Island, making the transition to the said northernmost channel using the triequidistant method between Pennyworth Island, the Georgia bank on Hutchinson Island, and the South Carolina mainland bank, thence to the thread of the said northernmost channel equidistant from the South Carolina mainland bank and Pennyworth Island at ordinary stage, around Pennyworth Island;
      Proceeding thence southeasterly to the thread of the northern channel of the Savannah River equidistant from the Georgia bank on Hutchinson Island and the South Carolina mainland bank, making the transition utilizing the triequidistant method between Pennyworth Island, the Georgia bank on Hutchinson Island, and the South Carolina mainland bank;
      Proceeding thence southeasterly down the thread of the Savannah River equidistant from the Hutchinson Island and South Carolina mainland banks of the river at ordinary stage, through the tide gates, until intersecting the northwestern (farthest upstream) boundary of the "Back River Sediment Basin," as defined in the "Annual Survey -- 1992, Savannah Harbor, Georgia, U.S. Coastal Highway, No. 17 to the Sea," U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District, as amended by the Examination Survey -- 1992 charts for the Savannah Harbor Deepening Project, Drawings No. DSH 112/107, (hereinafter the "Channel Chart");
      Proceeding thence along the said northwestern boundary to its intersection with the northern boundary of the Back River Sediment Basin, in a generally southeasterly direction until said boundary intersects the northern boundary of the main navigational channel as depicted on the Channel Chart at the point designated as SR-34 (Georgia State Grid, East Zone, 1927 NAD, coordinates x=849479.546, y=759601.757);
      Proceeding thence toward the mouth of the Savannah River along the northern boundary of the main navigational channel at the new channel limit as depicted on the Channel Chart, via Oglethorpe Range through point SR-33 (coordinates x=853126.849, y=761229.575), Fort Jackson Range through point SR-32 (coordinates x=854568.183, y=762555.255), the Bight Channel through points SR-31 (coordinates x=855854.367, y=765145.946), SR-30 (coordinates x=857363.583, y=766237.604), SR-29 (coordinates x=858471.561, y=766530.527), SR-28 (coordinates x=859881.928, y=766491.887), and SR-27 (coordinates x=861359.826, y=765804.794), Upper Flats Range through point SR-26 (coordinates x=863655.959, y=763821.629), Lower Flats Range through points SR-25 (coordinates x=865361.347, y=759910.744), SR-24 (coordinates x=866413.099, y=758260.171), SR-23 (coordinates x=867339.230, y=757647.194), SR-22 (coordinates x=870024.011, y=756511.390), and SR-21 (coordinates x=873855.646, y=755906.677), Crossing Range through points SR-20 (coordinates x=875581.821, y=754992.833), and SR-19 (coordinates x=884667.253, y=744780.789) and New Channel Range around the Rehandling Basin, and along the northern boundary of the Oyster Bed Island Turning Basin through point SR-16 (coordinates x=894907.977, y=742529.752), to the easternmost end of Oyster Bed Island at Navigational Buoy R "24";
      Proceeding thence from Navigational Buoy R "24" easterly along the mean low water line of Oyster Bed Island to the point at which the mean low water line of Oyster Bed Island intersects the Oyster Bed Island Training Wall;
      Proceeding thence along the southern edge of the Oyster Bed Island Training Wall until reaching the Jones Island Range line;
      Proceeding thence southeasterly along the Jones Island Range line until reaching the northern boundary of the main navigational channel as depicted on the Channel Chart;

The consent of the state is given to the acquisition by the United States by purchase, gift, exchange, or by condemnation according to law, of only such lands as may be contracted, proposed, or offered for sale in writing by the ostensible owner to the United States, in which writing the owner consents to such acquisition, of such lands in all those counties in the northern and central portions of the state south to and including the Counties of Stewart, Webster, Marion, Taylor, Upson, Monroe, Jones, Putnam, Greene, Taliaferro, Wilkes, Jasper, Elbert, Warren, Hancock, Oglethorpe, Dodge, Treutlen, Laurens, Butts, and Richmond, and in and around the Okefenokee Swamp as in the opinion of state and federal government officials may be needed for the establishment, consolidation, or extension of national forests, forest experiment stations, wildlife sanctuaries, or for rights of way and land on which to build roads, highways, and bridges in the Okefenokee Swamp or for rights of way and land on which to build roads, highways, and bridges to connect the swamp roads with other highways, or for any development purposes best suited on these lands to be acquired by the United States. The state shall retain concurrent jurisdiction with the United States in and over such lands in all cases insofar as civil process is concerned, and such criminal process as may issue under the authority of the state against any person charged with the commission of any crime outside or within the jurisdiction may be executed thereon in like manner as if this law had not been enacted. In all condemnation proceedings, the rights of the federal government shall be limited to the specific objects set forth by laws of the United States in regard to national forests or wildlife sanctuaries and rights of way on which to build roads, highways, and bridges.

              <p>The General Assembly recognizes the inherently unfair and inequitable results which occur in the strict application of the traditional doctrine of sovereign immunity.  On the other hand, the General Assembly recognizes that, while private entrepreneurs voluntarily choose the ambit of their activity and can thereby exert some control over their exposure to liability, state government does not have the same flexibility.  In acting for the public good and in responding to public need, state government must provide a broad range of services and perform a broad range of functions throughout the entire state, regardless of how much exposure to liability may be involved. The exposure of the state treasury to tort liability must therefore be limited. State government should not have the duty to do everything that might be done. Consequently, it is declared to be the public policy of this state that the state shall only be liable in tort actions within the limitations of this article and in accordance with the fair and uniform principles established in this article.</p>

              <p>The General Assembly also recognizes that the proper functioning of state government requires that state officers and employees be free to act and to make decisions, in good faith, without fear of thereby exposing themselves to lawsuits and without fear of the loss of their personal assets. Consequently, it is declared to be the public policy of this state that state officers and employees shall not be subject to lawsuit or liability arising from the performance or nonperformance of their official duties or functions.</p>

All tort actions against the state under this article shall be brought in the state or superior court of the county wherein the tort giving rise to the loss occurred; provided, however, that wrongful death actions may be brought in the county wherein the tort giving rise to the loss occurred or the county wherein the decedent died, and provided, further, that in any case in which an officer or employee of the state may be included as a defendant in his or her individual capacity, the action may be brought in the county of residence of such officer or employee.

            <p>§ 50-21-32. Signing of pleadings, motions, or other papers
In any claim, action, or proceeding brought under this article, the signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him or her that he or she has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.  If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant.  If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this Code section, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

Any judgments obtained in excess of this limitation on annual aggregate liability will not be void.  However, such excess judgments shall not be payable unless and until the General Assembly appropriates funds for the payment thereof.

The principal representative or his or her designee shall then select not less than three nor more than five persons deemed to be most highly qualified to perform the required professional services after considering, and based upon, such factors as the ability of professional personnel, past performance, willingness to meet time requirements, project location, office location, the professional's current and projected workloads, the professional's approach, quality control procedures, the volume of work previously awarded to the person by the state agency, and the extent to which said persons have and will involve minority subcontractors, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of contracts among qualified persons as long as such distribution does not violate the principle of selection of the most highly qualified person. In selection, as mentioned in this Code section, persons who maintain an office in Georgia shall be given preference when qualifications appear to be equal.

The board shall monitor the results of minority business participation and shall report the results of minority business participation to the Governor at least on an annual basis.

Securities eligible under this Code section are limited to:
(A)  Certificates of deposit issued by solvent banks or savings associations approved by the corporation and which are organized and existing under the laws of this state or under the laws of the United States;

              <p>If, in the discretion of the chief executive officer or his designee cancellation, denial, revocation, suspension, or rejection of renewal of a lottery retailer contract is in the best interest of the lottery, the public welfare, or the State of Georgia, the chief executive officer or his designee may cancel, suspend, revoke, or terminate, after notice and a right to a hearing, any contract issued pursuant to this chapter.  Such contract may, however, be temporarily suspended by the chief executive officer or his designee without prior notice pending any prosecution, hearing, or investigation, whether by a third party or by the chief executive officer.  A contract may be suspended, revoked, or terminated by the chief executive officer or his designee for any one or more of the reasons enumerated in this Code section. Any hearing held shall be conducted by the chief executive officer or his designee.  A party to the contract aggrieved by the decision of the chief executive officer or his designee may appeal the adverse decision to the board.  Such appeal shall be pursuant to the regulations, policies, and procedures set by the board and is not subject to Chapter 13 of this title, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act."

            <p>§ 50-27-22. Computation of rental payments of retailers
If a lottery retailer's rental payments for the business premises are contractually computed, in whole or in part, on the basis of a percentage of retail sales and such computation of retail sales is not explicitly defined to include sales of tickets or shares in a state operated or state managed lottery, only the compensation received by the lottery retailer from the corporation may be considered the amount of the lottery retail sale for purposes of computing the rental payment.

It is also the purpose of this article to establish procedures for setting off against any such prize the sum of any debt owed to the state or to persons on whose behalf the state and its claimant agencies act.  It is the intent of the General Assembly that this article be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.

Such pilot projects shall be approved by the Georgia Technology Authority. Such projects shall consider both commercial and government applications, be inclusive of major categories of electronic signature technology, and be established through a request for proposal process. The pilot projects are intended to provide a proof of concept for the application of technology, such as electronic signatures, and to serve to educate the General Assembly and the public at large as to the benefits of electronic signatures as well as the role of state government in any future regulatory capacity. One such pilot project may involve digital signatures and the use of a public key infrastructure established by a service provider. Any private partner chosen for these pilot projects may establish user fees to pay for the cost of these services so that no state funds would be required.</p>

            <p>§ 50-3-60. Official song
The song "Georgia on My Mind" with lyrics by Mr. Stuart Gorrell and music by Mr. Hoagy Carmichael is designated as the official song of the State of Georgia.
Georgia on My Mind 

Melodies bring memories

That linger in my heart

Make me think of Georgia

Why did we ever part?

Some sweet day when blossoms fall

And all the world's a song

I'll go back to Georgia

"Cause that's where I belong.

Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through

Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.

Georgia, Georgia, a song of you

Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines.

Other arms reach out to me

Other eyes smile tenderly

Still in peaceful dreams I see

The road leads back to you.

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find

Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.

            <p>§ 50-32-14. Expenditure of state or federal funds
In any case where a development of regional impact, as determined by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to Article 1 of Chapter 8 of this title, is planned within the geographic area over which the authority has jurisdiction which requires the expenditure of state or federal funds by the state or any political subdivision, agency, authority, or instrumentality thereof to create land transportation services or access to such development, any expenditure of such funds shall be prohibited unless and until the plan for such development and such expenditures is reviewed and approved by the authority. The decision of the authority to allow or disallow the expenditure of such funds shall be final and nonreviewable, except that such decision shall be reversed where a resolution for such purpose is passed by vote of three-fourths of the authorized membership of the county commission of the county in which the development of regional impact is planned or, if such development is within a municipality, by vote of three-fourths of the authorized membership of the city council. Such a vote shall not constitute failure or refusal by the local government for purposes of Code Section 50-32-53.

              <p>A guaranteed energy savings performance contract may provide that all payments, except obligations on termination of the contract before its scheduled expiration, shall be made over a period of time. The contract shall require the energy performance contractor to provide to the governmental unit an annual reconciliation of the guaranteed energy cost savings. The energy performance contractor shall be liable for any annual savings shortfall which may occur. In the event that such reconciliation reveals an excess in annual energy cost savings, such excess savings shall not be used to cover potential energy cost savings shortages in subsequent contract years. The guaranteed energy savings performance contract shall be for a firm fixed price. The governmental unit may require the qualified energy services provider to provide a payment and performance bond relating to the installation of energy conservation measures in the amount equal to 100 percent of the guaranteed energy savings performance contract.</p>

Calculation of the energy, water, waste-water, or operating cost savings or revenue increases may take into account rebates, grants, incentives, or similar payments available under published programs which are reasonably anticipated to be received by the governmental unit as a direct result of the work performed by the qualified energy services provider even though such payments are not included in the qualified energy services provider's contractual guarantee. Escalations and other financial considerations assumed in savings calculations shall be defined in the contract if they are included in the savings calculations and are required to meet the payback criteria and life cycle analysis.

The State of Georgia enacts, adopts, and agrees to be bound by the following compact:"ARTICLE I DECLARATION OF POLICY, PURPOSE, AND INTENT 
Whereas, every State enacting, adopting, and agreeing to be bound by this Compact intends to ensure that their respective legislature's use of the power to originate a Balanced Budget Amendment under Article V of the Constitution of the United States will be exercised conveniently and with r</p>

              <p>of each house of the Legislatures of the several States.

Section 6.  Notice. All notices required by this Compact shall be by U.S. Certified Mail, return receipt requested, or an equivalent or superior form of notice, such as personal delivery documented by evidence of actual receipt.Section 7.  'Balanced Budget Amendment' means the following:
ARTICLE -- 

Section 1.  Total outlays of the government of the United States shall not exceed total receipts of the government of the United States at any point in time unless the excess of outlays over receipts is financed exclusively by debt issued in strict conformity with this article.

Section 2.  Outstanding debt shall not exceed authorized debt, which initially shall be an amount equal to 105 percent of the outstanding debt on the effective date of this article. Authorized debt shall not be increased above its aforesaid initial amount unless such increase is first approved by the legislatures of the several states as provided in Section 3.

Section 3.  From time to time, Congress may increase authorized debt to an amount in excess of its initial amount set by Section 2 only if it first publicly refers to the legislatures of the several states an unconditional, single subject measure proposing the amount of such increase, in such form as provided by law, and the measure is thereafter publicly and unconditionally approved by a simple majority of the legislatures of the several states, in such form as provided respectively by state law; provided that no inducement requiring an expenditure or tax levy shall be demanded, offered, or accepted as a quid pro quo for such approval. If such approval is not obtained within sixty</p>

              <content>
                <p>calendar days after referral then the measure shall be deemed disapproved and the authorized debt shall thereby remain unchanged.

Section 4.  Whenever the outstanding debt exceeds 98 percent of the debt limit set by Section 2, the President shall enforce said limit by publicly designating specific expenditures for impoundment in an amount sufficient to ensure outstanding debt shall not exceed the authorized debt. Said impoundment shall become effective thirty</p>

              <content>
                <p>days thereafter, unless Congress first designates an alternate impoundment of the same or greater amount by concurrent resolution, which shall become immediately effective. The failure of the President to designate or enforce the required impoundment is an impeachable misdemeanor. Any purported issuance or incurrence of any debt in excess of the debt limit set by Section 2 is void.

Section 5.  No bill that provides for a new or increased general revenue tax shall become law unless approved by a two-thirds roll call vote of the whole number of each House of Congress. However, this requirement shall not apply to any bill that provides for a new end user sales tax which would completely replace every existing income tax levied by the government of the United States; or for the reduction or elimination of an exemption, deduction, or credit allowed under an existing general revenue tax.

Section 6.  For purposes of this article, 'debt' means any obligation backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States; 'outstanding debt' means all debt held in any account and by any entity at a given point in time; 'authorized debt' means the maximum total amount of debt that may be lawfully issued and outstanding at any single point in time under this article; "total outlays of the government of the United States" means all expenditures of the government of the United States from any source; 'total receipts of the government of the United States' means all tax receipts and other income of the government of the United States, excluding proceeds from its issuance or incurrence of debt or any type of liability; 'impoundment' means a proposal not to spend all or part of a sum of money appropriated by Congress; and 'general revenue tax' means any income tax, sales tax, or value-added tax levied by the government of the United States excluding imposts and duties.

Section 4.  When fewer than three-fourths of the States are Member States, any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting appropriate legislation, as determined by state law, and giving notice of such withdrawal to the Compact Administrator, if any, or otherwise to the chief executive officer of each other Member State. A withdrawal shall not affect the validity or applicability of the compact with respect to remaining Member States, provided that there remain at least two such States. However, once at least three-fourths of the States are Member States, then no Member State may withdraw from the Compact prior to its termination absent unanimous consent of all Member States.

              <p>In consultation with the metropolitan planning organization, as such term is defined in Code Section 48-8-242, which jurisdiction is located wholly or partially within the jurisdiction of the authority, the authority shall develop, annually review, and amend, as necessary, a regional transit plan. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to, transit projects based upon a region-wide approach to the provision of transit services through buses and rail, the establishment of multimodal stations within the jurisdiction of the authority, enhancement of connectivity throughout the region, cost-effective expansion of existing transit systems, and the coordination of schedules and methods of payment for transit service providers. In developing such plan, the authority may consider both macro level planning in order to efficiently coordinate transit services across jurisdictional lines as well as micro level planning of services being delivered by local governments and transit service operators, including the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, in order to ensure continuation of current services or routes. Such plan shall provide that the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority shall serve as the sole operator of any system of transportation which utilizes heavy rail within the jurisdiction of the authority.</p>

A department head or the Governor may create advisory councils. Any other official or agency of the executive branch of state government may also create advisory councils but only if federal laws or regulations require that the official or agency create the advisory council as a condition to the receipt of federal funds. Advisory councils may be created only for the purpose of acting in an advisory capacity. Unless otherwise provided by law, any such advisory council shall have a definite termination date in the instrument creating it, such date not to extend beyond the term of the Governor holding office at the time of the creation of the council.

              <p>The General Assembly recognizes that access to broadband services in today's society is essential to everyday life. Access to broadband services is a necessary service as fundamental as electricity, gas, or phone service. There is a growing need for the government of this state to provide the much needed infrastructure to the homes and businesses without access to broadband services due to their location in rural and other unserved areas. Furthermore, the General Assembly finds and declares that ensuring broadband services deployment will have a positive effect on education, health care, public safety, business and industry, government services, and leisure activities throughout the entire state. The General Assembly also finds and declares that guaranteeing an equitable deployment of broadband services throughout the state is a public necessity, one of the basic functions of government, and a benefit to the entire state. Moreover, the General Assembly finds and declares that it is in the best interest of the state and the persons who live and work in the state to spend state funds through the establishment of a grant program to ensure the creation of a state-wide foundation of broadband services infrastructure in unserved areas of the state.</p>

            <p>§ 50-5-12. Formulation of self-insurance program for workers' compensation for state employees; return to work program
The Department of Administrative Services shall formulate and initiate a sound program of self-insurance for workers' compensation benefits for all employees of the state, including employees of authorities. In formulating the self-insurance program, the department is directed to establish a return to work program that promotes the return of an employee to employment by creating transitional employment prior to full recovery by providing temporary assignments for an employee that are meaningful and medically approved until the employee can return to his or her regularly assigned duties. If an agency or authority does not allow an employee to engage in transitional employment under the return to work program, the number of authorized positions in the budget for the agency or authority shall be decreased by the number of employees collecting workers' compensation not engaged in return to work employment for whom return to work plans have been developed.

The department shall determine the amount and extent of self-insurance which the state can assume, the necessary reserves needed, the premiums to be charged and any deductibles to be paid by agencies and authorities, the amount of benefits to be paid within the scope of the workers' compensation statutes, and type of addition or excess insurance coverage that may be required. The department is further authorized to establish incentive programs including differential premium rates based on participation in loss control programs established by the department, increased or decreased deductibles based on participation in loss control programs established by the department, and the imposition of fines and penalties. If any premiums, deductibles, fines, or penalties are unpaid, the department is authorized to deduct any unpaid amounts from the nonpaying agency's or authority's continuation budget subject to the approval of the Office of Planning and Budget and deposit those funds into the workers' compensation trust fund provided for in Code Section 50-5-14.

            <p>§ 50-5-14. Authorization for Workers' Compensation Trust Fund to retain moneys as reserve; procedures for use of investment moneys
In order to finance the continuing liability established with other agencies of state government, the Workers' Compensation Trust Fund is authorized to retain all moneys paid into the fund as premiums on policies of insurance and all moneys received as interest and all moneys received from other sources as a reserve for the payment of such liability and the expenses necessary to the proper conduct of such insurance program administered by the fund. Any amounts held by the Workers' Compensation Trust Fund which are available for investment shall be paid over to the Office of the State Treasurer. The state treasurer shall deposit such funds in a trust account for credit only to the Workers' Compensation Trust Fund. The state treasurer shall invest such funds subject to the limitations of Code Section 50-5A-7 and Chapter 17 of this title. All income derived from such investments shall accrue to the Workers' Compensation Trust Fund. When moneys are paid over to the Office of the State Treasurer, as provided in this Code section, the commissioner shall submit an estimate of the date such funds shall no longer be available for investment. When the commissioner wishes to withdraw funds from the trust account provided for in this Code section, he or she shall submit a request for such withdrawal, in writing, to the state treasurer.

            <p>§ 50-6-29. Power to compel production of evidence
For the purpose of more completely discharging the duties resting upon him or her and to discover the truth and to make his or her reports truthful in all matters handled by him or her, the state auditor is empowered to conduct hearings, to summon witnesses, to administer oaths, to take the testimony of such witnesses, and to compel the production, inspection, and copying of documentary evidence, including without limitation evidence in electronic form and documentary evidence that is confidential or not available to the general public, at such time and place as he or she may designate for the purpose of investigating and determining the conduct and record of the employees and officials of any department of the state government. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the state auditor shall have access to inspect, compel production of, and copy confidential information in any form unless the law making such information confidential expressly refers to this Code section and qualifies or supersedes it in that particular instance. When the audit or special examination of the state auditor is concluded, the Department of Audits and Accounts shall redact, destroy, or return to the custodial agency all confidential information except that information which the state auditor determines is necessary to retain for audit purposes or to disclose for other public purposes. For audit purposes, the state auditor may retain such confidential information in working papers as is minimally necessary to support findings and to comply with generally accepted governmental auditing standards. The state auditor may also disclose confidential information to other officers independently entitled to its receipt, such as for law enforcement purposes. Except as stated above in this Code section, confidential information in the hands of the state auditor shall have the same confidential status as it does in the hands of the custodial entity, and the state auditor shall protect its confidentiality with at least the care and procedures by which it is protected by the custodial agency or substantially equivalent care and procedures.

In the event any witness summoned to appear in person or to produce documents fails or refuses to respond to such summons, it shall be the duty of the state auditor to certify the fact of refusal to a judge of the superior court of the county wherein such witness was required and directed to appear for the purpose of giving testimony or producing documentary evidence, which judge shall issue immediately an order to the party commanding him to appear immediately before the state auditor for the purpose of giving testimony or producing documentary evidence as directed in the notice or summons given by the state auditor. In the event of failure to respond to the summons of the court, the party shall be guilty of contempt of that court and shall be dealt with by the court accordingly.

            <p>§ 50-8-211. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds that in recent years rural Georgia has undergone a severe economic recession. It is evident that an investment in the economic situation of the state's most distressed counties would result not only in an improvement in the quality of life for the citizens of those counties but also in the economic health of the entire state by increasing the state's total economic growth.  There is a serious need in those less developed counties for jobs and for many fundamental community facilities which are essential to an improved quality of life and an equal opportunity for economic development.  The facilities needs of each less developed county are individually specific and the citizens of each such community will as a part of the growth strategies program determine which needs are of most importance and worth to their community.  Those economically distressed counties in many cases have exhausted all available funding resources in an attempt to help themselves but still do not have the economic ability to supply their facilities needs without substantial assistance from the state.  It is therefore essential that the General Assembly provide funding assistance to make possible the construction of such facilities as each county may determine necessary, based on need, priorities, merit, and planning, to improve the quality of life and economic development in the most economically distressed counties of this state.

No less developed county shall be eligible to receive a grant pursuant to this article until a local plan has been submitted.  The commissioner shall provide by rule or regulation for the submission of local plans and the administration of grant applications and shall establish criteria for the types of facilities which would qualify for a grant under this article; provided, however, that such criteria shall realistically reflect the diverse facility needs of the various less developed counties for economic development.  The commissioner shall submit such criteria to the General Assembly at the next regular session following July 1, 1991, and such criteria shall become effective only when ratified by joint resolution of the General Assembly. The power of the commissioner to promulgate such criteria shall be deemed to be dependent upon such ratification.

(1)  "Authority" means the Georgia Building Authority, the same being formerly known as the "State Office Building Authority."

(3)  "Cost of the project" means the cost of construction; the cost of all lands, properties, rights and easements, and franchises acquired; the cost of all machinery and equipment; financing charges; interest prior to and during construction and for one year after completion of construction; cost of engineering, architectural, and legal expenses and of plans and specifications and other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of the project; administrative expense and such other expenses as may be necessary or incident to the financing herein authorized, the construction of any project, the placing of the same in operation, and the condemnation of property necessary for such construction and operation. Any obligation or expense incurred for any of the foregoing purposes shall be regarded as a part of the cost of the project and may be paid or reimbursed as such out of the proceeds of revenue bonds issued under Article 2 of this chapter for such project.

(4)  "Project" means and includes one or a combination of two or more of the following: buildings and facilities intended for use as offices and related uses and all structures, including electric, gas, steam, and water utilities and facilities of every kind and character deemed by the authority necessary or convenient for the efficient operation of any department, board, commission, or agency of the state.

The bonds of each issue shall be dated; shall bear interest at the lowest obtainable rate, payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority; and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds.

If the proceeds of the bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or combined project, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund provided in Code Section 50-9-42 for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds.

          <content>
            <p>§ 50-9-40. Trust indentures as security; provisions
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of the revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the state. The trust indenture may pledge or assign rents, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor. The resolution or the trust indenture may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. The indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, the trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by the indenture.

(1)  The interest upon the revenue bonds as the interest falls due;

(2)  The principal of the bonds as the same falls due;

(3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest; and

(4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided.

The use and disposition of the sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchasing or redemption of bonds; and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall immediately be canceled and shall not again be issued.

Any holder of revenue bonds or interest coupons issued under this article, any receiver for such holders, or indenture trustee, if there is any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this article or Article 1 of this chapter or by resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, rents, and other charges for the use of the project or projects. In the event of default of the authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any revenue bond issue, any such holder, receiver, or indenture trustee shall be subrogated to each and every right, specifically including the contract rights of collecting rental, which the authority may possess against the state or any department, agency, or institution of the state and, in the pursuit of its remedies as subrogee, may proceed either at law or in equity by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceedings due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged directly or indirectly to the benefit of the revenue bond issue of which the individual, receiver, or trustee is representative. No holder of any such bond or receiver or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state; provided, however, any provision of this article or Article 1 of this chapter or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, any such bondholder or receiver or indenture trustee shall have the right by appropriate legal or equitable proceedings, including, without being limited to, mandamus, to enforce compliance by the appropriate public officials of Article VII, Section IV of the Constitution of this state; and permission is given for the institution of any such proceedings to compel the payment of lease obligations.

While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents or of any department, board, commission, or agency of the state shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of the bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. This article and Article 1 of this chapter shall be for the benefit of the state, the authority, and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of the bonds.
