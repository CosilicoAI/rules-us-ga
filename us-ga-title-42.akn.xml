          <heading>Injury or contact by inmate presenting possible threat of transmission of communicable disease</heading>
          <content>
            <p>§ 42-1-6. Injury or contact by inmate presenting possible threat of transmission of communicable disease
If any inmate of any state or county correctional institution, county or municipal jail, or other similar facility, while such inmate is in custody or in the process of being taken into custody, injures or has injured or contacts or has contacted a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, firefighter, emergency medical technician, or other person in such a manner as to present a possible threat of transmission of a communicable disease to the person so injured or contacted, then the warden, jailer, or other official having charge of such inmate may take all reasonable steps to determine whether the inmate has a communicable disease capable of being transmitted by the injury or contact involved. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, any appropriate medical examination of or collection of medical specimens from the inmate. In the event an inmate refuses to cooperate in any such procedures, the warden, jailer, or other official may apply to the superior court of the county for an order authorizing the use of any degree of force reasonably necessary to complete such procedures. Upon a showing of probable cause that the injury presents the threat of transmission of a communicable disease, the court shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to use reasonable measures to perform any medical procedures reasonably necessary to ascertain whether a communicable disease has been transmitted. In addition to any other grounds sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of such an order, such probable cause may be conclusively established by evidence of the injury or contact in question and a statement by a licensed physician that the nature of the injury or contact is such as to present a threat of transmission of a communicable disease if the inmate has such a disease. The cost of any procedures carried out under this Code section shall be borne by the jurisdiction having custody of the inmate.

The court shall also consider any relevant evidence submitted, and such evidence and documentation shall be mailed to the parties as well as submitted to the court. The court may hold a hearing to determine the issue of classification. The court may uphold the classification of the board, or, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the sexual offender is not placed in the appropriate classification level, the court shall place the sexual offender in the appropriate risk assessment classification. The court's determination shall be forwarded by the clerk of the court to the board, the sexual offender, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the sheriff of the county where the sexual offender is registered.</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 42-12-2. Legislative findings and determinationsThe General Assembly makes the following findings and determinations:
(1)  The costs of litigation are rising dramatically. It is the responsibility of this body to seek out and adopt measures to rectify this situation. One source of the rise in litigation costs is frivolous prisoner lawsuits. Meritless lawsuits are being filed at an ever-increasing rate by prisoners who view litigation as a recreational exercise. To address the problems caused by the filing of nonmeritorious lawsuits and to relieve some of the burden placed on Georgia cities, counties, state agencies, the courts, and the Department of Corrections, this chapter is enacted.

(2)  Before filing any sort of civil action, all citizens must evaluate the strengths of their claim in light of their own personal financial situation. Private individuals are forced to balance the strength of their case against the reality of court costs, filing fees, and the potential consequences of filing a frivolous or meritless lawsuit. Georgia's prisoners currently face no such dilemma. In light of the fact that all prisoners' needs are provided at city, county, or state expense, a prisoner cannot claim that his or her financial status or security would be compromised by a requirement to pay court costs and fees. To address this inequity, the General Assembly enacts this chapter.

(3)  In forma pauperis status will continue to allow the filing of an action by a prisoner, thus providing the prisoner with the constitutional right to access to courts. Freezing of the prisoner's inmate account will hold the prisoner responsible for court costs and fees by seizing any future deposits into the account.

            <p>§ 42-12-3. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Action" means any civil lawsuit, action, or proceeding, including an appeal, filed by a prisoner but shall not include an appeal of a criminal proceeding; provided, however, that the provisions of Code Sections 42-12-4 through 42-12-7 shall not apply to petitions for writ of habeas corpus.

(2)  "Court costs and fees" means the initial filing fee set by the clerk of court and all fees incident to service of the lawsuit or amendments.

(3)  "Indigent prisoner" means a prisoner who has insufficient funds in the prisoner's inmate account at the time of filing to pay the appropriate filing fee.

(4)  "Prisoner" means a person 17 years of age or older who has been convicted of a crime and is presently incarcerated or is being held in custody awaiting trial or sentencing.

          <content>
            <p>§ 42-2-14. Power of Governor to declare state of emergency with regard to jail and prison overcrowding
The Governor, upon certification by the commissioner of corrections and approval by the director of the Office of Planning and Budget that the population of the prison system of the State of Georgia has exceeded the capacity of the prison system for any period of 90 consecutive days, beginning at any time after December 31, 1988, may declare a state of emergency with regard to jail and prison overcrowding. Following the declaration of such emergency, the department may establish additional facilities for use by the department, such facilities to be either of a permanent type of construction or of a temporary or movable type as the department may find most advantageous to the particular needs, to the end that the inmates under its supervision may be so distributed throughout the state as to facilitate individualization of treatment designed to prepare them for lawful living in the community where they are most likely to reside after their release from a correctional facility. For this purpose, the department may purchase or lease sites and suitable lands and erect necessary buildings thereon or purchase or lease existing facilities, all within the limits of appropriations as approved by the General Assembly. With the approval of the Governor, provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 50, relating to the Department of Administrative Services, or provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 or Chapter 22 of Title 50, relating to control over acquisition of professional services, may be waived by the department to facilitate the rapid construction or procurement of facilities for inmates; provided, however, that the authority to waive provisions of Code Section 50-6-25 shall terminate as of July 1, 1991.  During any year in which correctional facilities are constructed or procured under this Code section and any requirements are waived, the department shall furnish the Governor and the General Assembly with a detailed report specifying the facilities constructed or procured, the requirements waived, and the reasons therefor.

            <p>§ 42-3-53. Placement with appropriate agency; approval by court; report of offender's performance
The community service officer shall place an offender sentenced to community service or educational advancement with an appropriate agency. The agency and work schedule shall be approved by the court. If the offender is employed at the time of sentencing or if the offender becomes employed after sentencing, the community service officer shall consider the offender's work schedule and, to the extent practicable, shall schedule the community service or educational advancement so that it will not conflict with the offender's work schedule. This scheduling accommodation shall not be construed as requiring the community service officer to alter scheduled community service or educational advancement based on changes in an offender's work schedule.

The court in which a person is charged with a felony for which bond is permissible under the law may, upon the application by the person so charged, at its discretion release the person prior to conviction and upon recognizance to the supervision of a pretrial release or diversion program established and operated by DCS after an investigation and upon recommendation of the staff of the pretrial release or diversion program. In no case, however, shall any person be so released unless after consultation with his or her attorney or an attorney made available to the person if he or she is indigent that person has voluntarily agreed to participate in the pretrial release or diversion program and knowingly and intelligently has waived his or her right to a speedy trial for the period of pretrial release or diversion.

              <p>of Code Section 15-1-4. While in such diversion program, the respondent shall be authorized to travel to and from his or her place of employment and to continue his or her occupation. The official in charge of the diversion program or his or her designee shall prescribe the routes, manner of travel, and periods of travel to be used by the respondent in attending to his or her occupation. If the respondent's occupation requires the respondent to travel away from his or her place of employment, the amount and conditions of such travel shall be approved by the official in charge of the diversion center or his or her designee. When the respondent is not traveling to or from his or her place of employment or engaging in his or her occupation, such respondent shall be confined in the diversion center during the term of the sentence. With the approval of the sheriff or his or her designee, the respondent may participate in educational or counseling programs offered at the diversion center. While participating in the diversion program, such respondent shall be liable for alimony or child support as previously ordered, including arrears, and his or her income shall be subject to the provisions of Code Sections 19-6-30 through 19-6-33.1 and Chapter 11 of Title 19. In addition, should any funds remain after payment of child support or alimony, such respondent may be charged a fee payable to the county operating the diversion program to cover the costs of his or her incarceration and the administration of the diversion program which fee shall be not more than $30.00 per day or the actual per diem cost of maintaining the respondent, whichever is less, for the entire period of time such respondent is confined to the diversion center and participating in the diversion program.

It shall be the duty of the grand jury, at each term of the superior court held in the county, to inquire into the contents of the record kept by the sheriff as required by Code Section 42-4-7. If the record is not kept or is incorrectly kept, the grand jury shall so report to the court. Upon the report's being made, the judge presiding shall cause the district attorney to have the sheriff served with a rule requiring him to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. The judge shall inquire into the facts and, if he finds that Code Section 42-4-7 has not been complied with, he shall impose a fine of not less than $25.00 nor more than $50.00 for the first offense and not more than $100.00 and not less than $50.00 for each subsequent offense. The fines shall be enforced and collected by attachment, as in other cases of attachments against sheriffs.

            <p>§ 42-4-12. Penalty for refusal by officer to receive persons charged with or guilty of offense
Except as otherwise provided in this Code section, any sheriff, constable, keeper of a jail, or other officer whose duty it is to receive persons charged with or guilty of an indictable offense who refuses to receive and take charge of such a person shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00. A sheriff, constable, keeper of a jail, or other officer whose duty it is to receive persons charged with or guilty of an indictable offense shall be authorized to refuse acceptance of any person who has not received medical treatment for obvious physical injuries or conditions of an emergency nature. Upon such refusal, it shall be the responsibility of the arresting agency to take the individual to a health care facility or health care provider in order to secure a medical release. Upon medical release by the health care facility or health care provider, the sheriff, constable, or keeper of the jail must assume custody of the individual; provided, however, that in all cases the sheriff, constable, or keeper of the jail must assume custody where no health care facility is located in the county in which the arrest occurred and, in such instances, the governing authority of the arresting agency shall pay all costs related to the medical release.

            <p>§ 42-4-101. Bonds or other obligations not indebtedness of state or political subdivision; payment
No bonds or other obligations of and no indebtedness incurred by any authority shall constitute an indebtedness or obligation of the State of Georgia or of any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor shall any act of any authority in any manner constitute or result in the creation of an indebtedness of this state or of any such county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision. However, provisions of this Code section shall not preclude counties, municipal corporations, or other political subdivisions from choosing to guarantee the bonds, indebtedness, or other obligations of a jail authority as part of its demonstration of adequate financial responsibility pursuant to this article. All such bonds and obligations shall be payable solely from the revenues therein pledged to such payment, including pledged rentals, sales proceeds, insurance proceeds, and condemnation awards; and no holder or holders of any such bond or obligation shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of this state or of any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state or of any such county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision.

              <p>Notwithstanding any language in the sentence as passed by the court, the commissioner may designate as a place of confinement any available, suitable, and appropriate state or county correctional institution in this state operated under the jurisdiction or supervision of the department. The commissioner shall also have sole authority to transfer inmates from one state or county correctional institution in this state to any other such institution operated by or under the jurisdiction or supervision of or approved by the board. Neither male nor female state inmates shall be assigned to serve in any manner in a county jail unless they are participating in a state sponsored project and have the approval of the commissioner and the sheriff or the jail administrator of the county. Furthermore, the commissioner may transfer to the Attorney General of the United States for confinement any inmate if it is determined that the custody, care, treatment, training, or rehabilitation of the inmate has not been adequate or in the best interest of the inmate or his fellow inmates. The commissioner is authorized to contract with the Attorney General of the United States for the custody, care, subsistence, housing, treatment, training, and rehabilitation of such inmates.

The commissioner may transfer any juvenile under 17 years of age from the penal institution in which he or she is serving to the Department of Juvenile Justice, provided that the transfer is approved thereby. The juvenile may be returned to the custody of the commissioner when the commissioner of juvenile justice determines that the juvenile is unsuited to be dealt with therein. The commissioner may accept a juvenile for transfer into a penal institution upon the request of the commissioner of juvenile justice if such juvenile is 16 years of age or older and has been committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for a class A designated felony act or class B designated felony act, as defined by Code Section 15-11-2, and such juvenile's behavior presents a substantial danger to any person at or within a Department of Juvenile Justice facility. In the event of such transfer, the department shall have the same authority over and responsibility for such juvenile as the Department of Juvenile Justice has for such juvenile and shall maintain sight and sound separation as set forth in paragraph</p>

              <p>The commissioner shall maintain an educational program within the state prison system to assist inmates in achieving at least a fifth-grade level on standardized reading tests. Inmates who test below the fifth-grade level and who have been sentenced to incarceration for a period of one year or longer shall be required by institutional staff to attend appropriate classes until they attain this level or until they are released from incarceration, whichever event occurs first; provided, however, that inmates who have remained in the educational program for 90 school days may voluntarily withdraw thereafter. The commissioner or his designee shall have the discretion to exclude certain inmates from the provisions of this subsection due to the inability of such inmates to benefit from an educational program for reasons which may include: custody status, particularly of those inmates under a death sentence; mental handicap or physical illness; participation in a boot camp program; or possession of a general education diploma or high school diploma. The State Board of Pardons and Paroles shall incorporate satisfactory participation in such an educational program into the parole guidelines adopted pursuant to Code Section 42-9-40.</p>

The warden or superintendent of any penal institution in which inmates committed to the custody of the commissioner have been assigned may authorize, without the prior written approval of the commissioner, emergency leave to an inmate when it is confirmed that there exists a serious illness or death in the inmate's immediate family and when notice and confirmation of the illness or death does not reach the warden or superintendent in time to authorize special leave in the manner provided in Code Section 42-5-81. Emergency leave cannot be granted under this Code section to any inmate who has been convicted of a sex offense, who has escaped or attempted to escape within 12 months preceding the emergency, who has not served sufficient time to demonstrate his responsibility and dependability, or who has an assaultive pattern determined to exist either from the nature of the offense for which he has been convicted or from conduct while incarcerated in the penal institution. The warden or superintendent granting the emergency leave must forward immediately a written report of the action to the commissioner.

            <p>§ 42-7-8. Court recommendation of treatment as youthful offender
If a court finds that a youthful offender might benefit from this chapter, the court may recommend that a young offender be treated as a youthful offender by indicating the recommendation in writing in the sentence itself. When the judge has recommended in the sentence that a person be given youthful offender treatment, release may be made without regard to limitations placed upon the service of a portion of the prison sentence provided by Code Section 42-9-45. After the offender is evaluated, the department will make the decision concerning the placement of the offender.

              <p>DCS shall make periodic audits of each officer who, by virtue of the officer's duties, has any moneys, fines, court costs, property, or other funds coming into the officer's control or possession or being disbursed by such officer. DCS shall keep a permanent record of the audit of each officer's accounts on file. It shall be the duty of the employee of DCS conducting the audit to notify DCS in writing of any discrepancy of an illegal nature that might result in prosecution. DCS shall have the right to interview and make inquiry of certain selected payors or recipients of funds, as it may choose, without notifying the officer, to carry out the purposes of the audit. The employee who conducts the audit shall be required to give bond in such amount as may be set by DCS, in the same manner and for the same purposes as provided under Code Section 42-8-26 for the bonds of officers. The bond shall bind the employee and the employee's surety in the performance of the employee's duties.</p>

The period of probation or suspension shall not exceed the maximum sentence of confinement which could be imposed on the defendant.</p>

The probation fee may be waived or amended after administrative process by DCS and approval of the court, or upon determination by the court, as to the undue hardship, inability to pay, or any other extenuating factors which prohibit collection of the fee; provided, however, that the imposition of sanctions for failure to pay fees shall be within the discretion of the court through judicial process or hearings. Probation fees shall be waived on probationers incarcerated or detained in a Department of Corrections or other confinement facility which prohibits employment for wages.

In addition, the affidavit shall contain a succinct statement as to what efforts DCS has made in trying to collect the delinquent amount. The affidavit shall then be submitted to the sentencing court for approval. Upon signature and approval of the court, such arrearage shall then be collectable through issuance of a writ of fieri facias by the clerk of the sentencing court; and DCS may enforce such collection through any judicial or other process or procedure which may be used by the holder of a writ of execution arising from a civil action.</p>

              <p>The satisfactory report of performance in the program from the Department of Corrections shall, in addition to the other requirements specified in this Code section, require participation of the individual confined in the unit in such adult education courses necessary to attain the equivalency of a grade five competency level as established by the State Board of Education for elementary schools. Those individuals who are mentally disabled as determined by initial testing shall be exempt from mandatory participation. After the individual is released from the unit, it shall be a special condition of probation that the individual participate in an education program in the community until grade five level competency is achieved or active probation supervision terminates. It shall be the duty of the Department of Corrections to certify to the trial court that such individual has satisfactorily completed such condition of probation while on active probation supervision. The receipt of an unsatisfactory report may be grounds for revocation of the probated sentence as would any other violation of a condition or term of probation. Under certain circumstances, the probationer may be exempt from this requirement if it is determined by the officer that community education resources are inaccessible to the probationer.

If only part of the balance of the probation is revoked, the probationer shall still be responsible for the full amount of the unpaid fines, restitution, and other moneys upon his or her return to probation after release from imprisonment.

When a defendant is pro se, the court shall inquire as to the defendant's interest in entering a plea pursuant to the terms of this article. If the defendant expresses a desire to be sentenced as a first offender, the court shall ask the prosecuting attorney or probation official if the defendant is eligible for sentencing as a first offender. When imposing a sentence, the court shall ensure that, if a defendant is sentenced as a first offender, he or she is made aware of the consequences of entering a first offender plea pursuant to the terms of this article.

              <p>If it appears to the court upon a hearing of the matter that the defendant is not likely to engage in an unlawful course of conduct and that the ends of justice and the welfare of society do not require that the defendant shall presently suffer the penalty imposed by law, the court in its discretion may place the defendant on probation under the supervision and control of a probation officer or private probation officer for all or a portion of the sentence or may impose a sentence upon the defendant but stay and suspend the execution of such sentence or any portion thereof. The period of probation or suspension shall not exceed the maximum sentence of confinement which could be imposed on the defendant; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the ability of a court to toll a sentence as provided in this article.</p>

              <p>When pay-only probation is imposed, the total maximum fee collected shall be capped so as not to exceed three months of ordinary probation supervision fees at a monthly rate not to exceed the rate set forth in the contract between the court and the provider of services, notwithstanding the number of cases for which a fine and statutory surcharge were imposed or that the defendant was sentenced to serve consecutive sentences; provided, however, that collection of such fee shall terminate as soon as all court imposed fines and statutory surcharges are paid in full; and provided, further, that when all such fines and statutory surcharges are paid in full, the probation officer or private probation officer, as the case may be, shall submit an order to the court terminating the probated sentence within 30 days of fulfillment of such conditions. Within 90 days of receiving such order, the court shall issue an order terminating such probated sentence or issue an order stating why such probated sentence shall continue.</p>

              <p>When a defendant is serving consecutive misdemeanor sentences, whether as a result of one case from one jurisdiction or multiple cases from multiple jurisdictions, upon motion by the defendant, the court may discharge such defendant from further supervision or otherwise terminate probation when it is satisfied that its action would be in the best interest of justice and the welfare of society.

              <p>When a defendant is serving consecutive misdemeanor sentences, his or her probation officer or private probation officer, as the case may be, shall review such case after 12 consecutive months of probation supervision wherein the defendant has paid in full all court imposed fines, statutory surcharges, and restitution and has otherwise completed all testing, evaluations, and rehabilitative treatment programs ordered by the court to determine if such officer recommends early termination of probation. Each such case shall be reviewed every four months thereafter for the same determination until the termination, expiration, or other disposition of the case. If such officer recommends early termination, he or she shall immediately submit an order to the court to effectuate such purpose.

(A)  The probationer has failed to report to his or her probation officer or private probation officer, as the case may be, on at least two occasions;

(B)  The officer has attempted to contact the probationer at least two times by telephone or e-mail at the probationer's last known telephone number or e-mail address, which information shall be listed in the affidavit;

(C)  The officer has checked the local jail rosters and determined that the probationer is not incarcerated;

(D)  The officer has sent a letter by first-class mail to the probationer's last known address, which shall be listed in the affidavit, advising the probationer that the officer will seek a tolling order if the probationer does not report to such officer in person within ten days of the date on which the letter was mailed; and(E)  The probationer has failed to report to the probation officer or private probation officer, as the case may be, as directed in the letter set forth in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph and ten days have passed since the date on which the letter was mailed.</p>

(1)  The failure to install an ignition interlock device pursuant to an order of probation granted on or after May 1, 1999, but prior to May 1, 2000, shall not be ground for suspension or revocation of driving privileges, revocation of probation, refusal to issue a probationary driver's license, or refusal to reinstate a driver's license for the person granted such probation unless the order granting such probation unequivocally conditioned probation upon the installation of an ignition interlock device; and

(2)  In the case of any person who had installed and maintained an ignition interlock device in a motor vehicle for a period of six months pursuant to any order of probation granted on or after May 1, 1999, but prior to May 1, 2000, any lack of certification of such ignition interlock device or of the provider center for such device or lack of a limited driving permit for the period of use of such device shall not be ground for suspension or revocation of driving privileges, revocation of probation, refusal to issue a probationary driver's license, or refusal to reinstate a driver's license for the person subject to such order if such installation and the monitoring required by this article for the required period of maintenance is confirmed in writing by the provider center for such device.

The guidelines system shall be used in determining parole actions on all inmates, except those serving life sentences, who will become statutorily eligible for parole consideration. The system shall be consistent with the board's primary goal of protecting society and shall take into consideration the severity of the current offense, the inmate's prior criminal history, the inmate's conduct, and the social factors which the board has found to have value in predicting the probability of further criminal behavior and successful adjustment under parole supervision.</p>

              <p>The board is authorized to obtain from any penal institution, with at least 60 days prior notice to that institution, and any such penal institution is authorized to provide the board with HIV test results regarding any person who applies or is eligible for clemency, a pardon, a parole, or other relief from a sentence or to require such person to submit to an HIV test and to consider the results of any such test in determining whether to grant clemency, a pardon, a parole, or other relief to such person. Test results obtained pursuant to the authority of this Code section may not be the sole basis for determining whether to grant or deny any such relief to such person, however. The board is further authorized to impose conditions upon any person to whom the board grants clemency, a pardon, a parole, or other relief and who is determined by an HIV test to be infected with HIV, which conditions may include without being limited to those designed to prevent the spread of HIV by that person.

              <p>The board, upon placing a person on parole or conditional release, shall specify in writing the terms and conditions thereof, and if such person is serving a split sentence, the board's conditions shall include all of the terms of probation imposed by the sentencing court. A certified copy of the conditions shall be given to the parolee or conditional releasee. Thereafter, a copy shall be sent to the clerk of the court in which the person was convicted. The board shall adopt general rules concerning the terms and conditions of parole or conditional release and concerning what shall constitute a violation thereof and shall make special rules to govern particular cases. The rules, both general and special, may include, among other things, a requirement that the parolee or conditional releasee shall not leave this state or any definite area in this state without the consent of the board; that the parolee or conditional releasee shall contribute to the support of his or her dependents to the best of the parolee's or conditional releasee's ability; that the parolee or conditional releasee shall make reparation or restitution for his or her crime; that the parolee or conditional releasee shall abandon evil associates and ways; and that the parolee or conditional releasee shall carry out the instructions of his or her community supervision officer, and, in general, so comport himself or herself as the community supervision officer shall determine. A violation of the terms of parole or conditional release may render the parolee or conditional releasee liable to arrest and a return to a penal institution to serve out the term for which the parolee or conditional releasee was sentenced.</p>

              <p>Each parolee or conditional releasee who does not have a high school diploma or a general educational development (GED) diploma shall be required as a condition of parole or conditional release to obtain a high school diploma or general educational development (GED) diploma or to pursue a trade at a vocational or technical school. Any such parolee or conditional releasee who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the board an existing ability or skill which does in fact actually furnish the parolee or conditional releasee a reliable, regular, and sufficient income shall not be subject to this subsection. Any parolee or conditional releasee who is determined by the department or the board to be incapable of completing such requirements shall only be required to attempt to improve his or her basic educational skills.

            <p>§ 42-9-46. Cases in which inmate has failed to serve time required for automatic initial consideration; objections
When the board considers a case in which an inmate has not served the time required by Code Section 42-9-45 for automatic initial parole consideration, the board shall notify in writing, at least ten days prior to such early consideration, the sentencing judge, the district attorney of the circuit in which the inmate was sentenced, and any victim of a violation of Chapter 5 of Title 16 or, if such victim is deceased, the spouse, children, or parents of the deceased victim if such person's contact information has been provided to the board with a current mailing or e-mail address and telephone number. Such notice shall provide a time frame in which such individuals may file an objection to early parole consideration. The sentencing judge, district attorney, or victim or, if such victim is deceased, the spouse, children, or parents of the deceased victim shall be given notice of a hearing date if a hearing will be held and, in order to express their views and make their recommendation as to whether the inmate should be granted early parole, may appear at such hearing or may make a written statement to the board. If an objection was filed and the board grants early parole, it shall issue a statement explaining its reasoning for granting such parole and such statement shall be served on any party who filed an objection.

Within 72 hours after the board reaches a final decision to parole an inmate, the district attorney, the presiding judge, the sheriff of each county in which the inmate was tried, convicted, and sentenced, the local law enforcement authorities of the county of the last residence of the inmate prior to incarceration, and the victim of crimes against the person shall be notified of the decision by the chairman of the board.

            <p>§ 42-9-49. Reimbursement of counties for incarceration of persons arrested in accordance with Code Section 42-9-48
After proper documentation is received from the county, the board shall reimburse the county, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the board and in the amount appropriated for this purpose by the General Assembly, for the cost of incarceration of any person who is arrested pursuant to any warrant issued in accordance with Code Section 42-9-48. To the extent that funds are appropriated by the General Assembly for the purpose of reimbursement of medical expenses, the board may reimburse counties for the cost of medical services provided to persons so arrested. The liability of the board for such costs of incarceration shall begin when the person is incarcerated and shall end upon revocation of parole or conditional release of the person. This Code section shall apply only to cases in which the board's warrant is the sole basis for incarceration.

Where a hearing officer has determined, after finding probable cause, that the alleged violator should be set free on his personal recognizance, the board may overrule that decision and order the alleged violator to be incarcerated pending his final hearing.

If the board determines that there has been no violation of the conditions of the parole or conditional release, then the parolee or the releasee shall be reinstated upon his original parole or conditional release without any loss of time and the order of temporary revocation of parole or conditional release and the warrant shall be withdrawn.</p>

              <p>When a parolee or conditional releasee is serving a split sentence for a qualified offense, as such term is defined in Code Section 42-8-21, the board shall review such case after such parolee or conditional releasee has successfully completed 12 consecutive months of parole supervision to consider commutation of such sentence. The board may relieve a parolee or conditional releasee from making further reports and may permit such person to leave the state or county if satisfied that this is for the parolee's or conditional releasee's best interest and for the best interest of society. When a parolee or conditional releasee has, in the opinion of the board, so conducted himself or herself as to deserve a pardon or a commutation of sentence or the remission in whole or in part of any fine, forfeiture, or penalty, the board may grant such relief in cases within its power. The board may take into consideration whether or not a person is serving a split sentence in its determination of granting any relief.

            <p>§ 42-9-81. Execution of compact

The Governor of this state is authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the State of Georgia with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:"ARTICLE I. PURPOSE. 
The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the By-laws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112(1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no 'right' of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and By-laws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS.

(4)  "Compacting state' means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.

(5)  "Commissioner' means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact.
