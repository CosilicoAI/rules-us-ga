          <p>At such intervals and for such periods as the board of directors may authorize, dividends and interest from retained earnings may be declared at such rates as are determined by the board, provided that such dividends and interest shall not be paid until provision for the transfer to the allowance for loan losses has been made.Dividends or interest in excess of 100 percent of a credit union's net earnings before dividends shall be approved in writing by the department prior to payment, provided that an application from a credit union with net worth equal to or in excess of the requirements for a well-capitalized credit union, as defined by the National Credit Union Administration rules and regulations, shall be deemed to be approved five business days after the receipt of the dividend approval form by the department unless the department notifies the credit union that the dividend is not approved within this period.The proposed dividend or interest may be paid after approval by the department upon its determination that such payment would be in the continued best interest of the credit union, would promote its stability, and would not impair its ability to repay its creditors other than its shareholders and depositors.</p>
