            <p>§ 43-1-29. Suspension of license for nonpayment of student loans; procedure; reinstatement
A professional licensing board shall suspend the license of a person licensed by that board who has been certified by a federal agency and reported to the board for nonpayment or default or breach of a repayment or service obligation under any federal educational loan, loan repayment, or service conditional scholarship program. Prior to the suspension, the licensee shall be entitled to notice of the board's intended action and opportunity to appear before the board according to procedures set forth by the division director in rules and regulations. A suspension of a license under this Code section is not a contested case under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." A license suspended under this Code section shall not be reinstated or reissued until the person provides the licensing board a written release issued by the reporting agency stating that the person is making payments on the loan or satisfying the service requirements in accordance with an agreement approved by the reporting agency. If the person has continued to meet all other requirements for licensure during the period of suspension, reinstatement of the license shall be automatic upon receipt of the notice and payment of any reinstatement fee which the board may impose.

            <p>§ 43-10-16. Injunction against unlicensed or unregistered practice
The board may bring an action to enjoin any person from engaging in barbering or the practice or the occupation of a cosmetologist, hair designer, esthetician, nail technician, master barber, or barber II if such person without being licensed to do so by the board engages in or practices barbering or the practice or occupation of a cosmetologist, hair designer, esthetician, nail technician, master barber, or barber II. The action shall be brought in the county in which such individual resides or, in the case of a firm or corporation, where the firm or corporation maintains its principal office; and, unless it appears that such person so engaging or practicing in barbering or the practice or occupation of a cosmetologist, hair designer, esthetician, nail technician, master barber, or barber II is licensed, the injunction shall be issued, and such person shall be perpetually enjoined from engaging or practicing in such activities throughout the state. It shall not be necessary in order to obtain the equitable relief provided in this Code section for the board to allege and prove that there is no adequate remedy at law. It is declared that the unlicensed activities referred to in this Code section are a menace and a nuisance dangerous to the public health, safety, and welfare.

              <p>No dentist licensed and practicing in the State of Georgia shall administer either single or multiple pharmacologic agents by oral, parenteral, enteral, transdermal, or transmucosal route that renders a patient to a state of conscious sedation as defined in Code Section 43-11-1, unless such dentist has been issued a permit by the board under the conditions specified therefor in this Code section. The dentist shall ensure that the pharmacologic agents and methods used to administer such agents shall include a margin of safety so that loss of consciousness of the patient is unlikely. This Code section shall not restrict the use of nitrous oxide or pharmacological agents that do not render a patient to a state of conscious sedation.

A person who furnishes the board satisfactory proof of being currently licensed to practice as a dental hygienist in another state and who has applied for, paid the fee for, and been authorized by the board to take the examination required by Code Section 43-11-70 shall be issued a temporary license to practice as a dental hygienist in this state.  The temporary license shall be valid from the date of issuance until the results of the first examination scheduled for the applicant are released.  If the applicant fails the examination or fails to appear at the examination, the temporary license shall automatically become invalid.  No such temporary license shall be issued more than one time nor shall a temporary license be issued to an applicant who has previously failed the examination.  If the applicant passes the examination, the temporary license shall remain valid until a license is issued.  A temporary license shall be posted and displayed in the place in which the dental hygienist is employed.

          <content>
            <p>§ 43-13-4. Qualifications of driver training school operatorsEvery person who desires to operate a driver training school or a commercial driver training school shall meet the following requirements:
(1)  Be of good moral character;

(2)  Maintain an established place of business in the State of Georgia which is open to the public;

(3)  Maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance on motor vehicles while used in driver training instruction, insuring the liability of the driver training school, the driving instructors, and any person taking instruction, in at least the following amounts: $100,000.00 for bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject to such limit for one person, $300,000.00 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident and the amount of $50,000.00 for damage to property of others in any one accident. Evidence of such insurance coverage, in the form of a certificate from the insurance carrier, shall be filed with the department; and such certificate shall stipulate that the insurance shall not be canceled except upon ten days' prior written notice to the department. Such insurance shall be written by a company authorized to do business in this state;

(4)  Provide a continuous surety company bond in the principal sum of $10,000.00 for the protection of the contractual rights of students in such form as will meet with the approval of the department and written by a company authorized to do business in this state; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the surety for all breaches of the condition of the bond in no event shall exceed the principal sum of $10,000.00 per location, and a single bond at such rate for all schools operated by the same person may be provided in satisfaction of this paragraph. The surety on any such bond may cancel such bond on giving 30 days' notice thereof in writing to the department and shall be relieved of liability for any breach of any condition of the bond which occurs after the effective date of cancellation. If at any time said bond is not valid and in force, the license of the school or program shall be deemed suspended by operation of law until a valid surety company bond is again in force;

(5)  Have the equipment necessary to the giving of proper instruction in the operation of motor vehicles as prescribed by the department;

(6)  Pay to the department an application fee for the approval of driver training schools and instructors, commercial driver training schools and instructors, and limited license driver training schools and instructors. The amount of this fee shall be established by the commissioner of driver services and shall, as best as the commissioner shall determine, approximate the expense incurred by the department in consideration of the license applications. These licenses and each renewal thereof shall be valid for a period of four years unless suspended or revoked prior to the expiration of that time period;

(7)  Submit at least one set of classifiable electronically recorded fingerprints to the department in accordance with the fingerprint system of identification established by the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The department shall transmit the fingerprints to the Georgia Crime Information Center, which shall submit the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a search of bureau records and an appropriate report and promptly conduct a search of state records based upon the fingerprints. After receiving the report from the Georgia Crime Information Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the department shall determine whether the applicant may be certified; and

(8)  Be a United States citizen, or if not a citizen, present federal documentation verified by the United States Department of Homeland Security to be valid documentary evidence of lawful presence in the United States under federal immigration law.

The fact that the statute under which the individual was issued a certificate of qualification or registration in another state does not provide that the required written examination be passed subsequent to the acquisition of the required experience shall not be deemed as a conflict with, or lower than, the Georgia requirements, provided that the written examination and the amount of experience required for registration are substantially equivalent to the Georgia requirements.</p>

If a judgment is rendered in such action by which it is determined that the applicant is liable for damages under this chapter and the applicant has not paid the judgment within ten days of the date the judgment became final or if the applicant petitions the Supreme Court of the United States to take certiorari jurisdiction over such action and the applicant has not paid the judgment within ten days of the date the Supreme Court of the United States denies certiorari jurisdiction or within ten days of the date the Supreme Court of the United States affirms the judgment, then such person may petition the Superior Court of Fulton County for an order directing the Secretary of State to reduce such deposit or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the judgment to cash or its equivalent and to pay such judgment to the extent the judgment may be satisfied with the proceeds of the deposit. If there shall remain any residue from the deposit and if at least two years have passed since the expiration or revocation of the applicant's registration, the Secretary of State shall pay such residue to the applicant, taking his receipt for the residue, which shall be filed and recorded with the other papers of the case, unless there is pending against the applicant an action (including any direct appeal of such action </p>

            <p>§ 43-20-18. Injunctions
The board shall have the power to bring an action to enjoin any person, firm, or corporation who, without being licensed or issued a permit by the board, dispenses hearing aids in this state. The action shall be filed in the county in which such person resides or practices or in the county where the firm or corporation maintains an office or practices. If it shall appear that the person, firm, or corporation is guilty of dispensing hearing aids without a license or permit issued by the board, then such person, firm, or corporation shall be enjoined from dispensing hearing aids without a valid license or permit throughout the state. It is declared that such unlicensed activities are a menace and a nuisance and are dangerous to the public health, safety, and welfare; and, therefore, it shall not be necessary, in order to obtain relief, as provided in this Code section, for the board to allege or prove that there is no adequate remedy at law.

A written statement prominently setting forth in bold type the time period during which a guest may occupy an assigned room, when separately signed or initialed by the guest, is a valid nonassignable contract.  At the expiration of such time period, the guest may be restrained from entering such room and any property of the guest may be removed by the innkeeper to a secure place where the guest may recover his or her property without liability to the innkeeper, except for damages to or loss of such property attributable to its removal.  If a guest vacates his or her room prior to the date contained in the written statement, that guest shall not be liable for charges for the time after the room is vacated unless the guest has agreed otherwise before occupying the room.

The keeper of every inn, boarding house, lodging house, and eating house shall have a lien on all furniture, baggage, wearing apparel, and other property brought into such inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house by any guest or patron of the same who has title to such property, or by an agent who has legally acquired possession of such property for the purpose of dealing therewith for the benefit of the owner and in and about the business of the owner, to secure the payment by such guest or patron of all sums due for food, lodging, or other accommodation. The lien shall attach in all cases where a liability has been created without regard to the time of furnishing such food, lodging, or other accommodation and shall be superior to other liens except liens for taxes, liens for purchase money or retention of title of record, special liens of landlords for rent, liens of laborers, and all general liens of which the keeper of such inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house had actual notice or constructive notice before the property claimed to be subject was brought into such inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house.

            <p>§ 43-21-6. Enforcement of lien created by Code Section 43-21-5
For the enforcement of the lien created by Code Section 43-21-5, the keeper of the inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house claiming the lien may retain possession of the property against which the lien is claimed. At any time after 30 days after the person creating such debt or obligation has left the inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house, if the debt or obligation is still unpaid, the innkeeper may sell at public auction at the office of the inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house where such lien is claimed, to the highest bidder for cash, any and all property subject to such lien, without any further process being necessary. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied, first, to the payment of the expense of such sale; second, to the reduction or discharge of the debt or obligation due to the inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house; and any surplus remaining shall be held subject to the demand of the person creating such debt or obligation, provided that such sale shall be advertised by written or printed posters at the office of the inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house and at the courthouse door of the county in which the inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house is located for at least ten days before such sale. The advertisement shall specify the time and place of sale. The keeper of the inn, boarding house, lodging house, or eating house shall give the owner or agent, or both, written notice by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery addressed to him at his last known address at least ten days prior to the sale, notifying him of the time and place of sale and of the amount claimed against him. Any surplus proceeds of the sale, after payment of the amount claimed against such owner or agent and the cost of sale, if not claimed by the owner or agent within 12 months after the sale, shall be turned over to the board of education of the county in which the sale occurred for educational purposes.

            <p>§ 43-21-12. Presumption of failure of innkeeper to exercise extraordinary diligence upon loss of entrusted property; defenses; limitation on liability
In case of loss of property entrusted by a guest to an innkeeper, it will be presumed that the innkeeper failed to exercise extraordinary diligence with regard to such property. Negligence or default by the guest, of which the loss is a consequence, shall be a sufficient defense. The liability of the innkeeper for loss of or injury to personal property placed by any guest under the innkeeper's care, other than valuable articles which must be delivered to the innkeeper to be deposited in a safe or other place of deposit, shall not exceed the sum of $1,000.00, provided that any guest may, at any time before loss, damage, or destruction of the guest's property, notify the innkeeper in writing that the property of the guest exceeds in value the sum of $1,000.00 and shall, upon demand of the innkeeper, furnish the innkeeper a list or schedule of the same, with the value thereof, in which case the innkeeper shall be liable for the full value of such property in case of loss, damage, or destruction because of negligence on the innkeeper's part; provided, further, that the innkeeper shall post a copy of this Code section, printed in distinct type, on the inside of the door of the guest's room. The innkeeper may adopt reasonable regulations for the innkeeper's protection, and the publication of such rules to the innkeeper's guests shall bind them to comply therewith.

Any partnership, firm, limited liability company, or corporation may engage in the practice of landscape architecture, as defined in this chapter, provided that any service which constitutes the practice of landscape architecture shall be supervised by a duly licensed landscape architect who shall be responsible for the services furnished by the partnership, firm, limited liability company, or corporation which would otherwise fall within the purview of this chapter. In no event shall the other members of the partnership, limited liability company, firm, or corporation be designated or described as landscape architects if they are not so licensed; and the term landscape architect or any abbreviation thereof or any other designation which conveys the meaning of landscape architect shall not appear in any partnership, firm, limited liability company, or corporate name in which any person is identified who is in fact not a licensed landscape architect. Upon approval of the board, any partnership, limited liability company, firm, or corporation may operate branch offices in this state to provide landscape architectural services, provided that each branch office has a resident landscape architect licensed under this chapter. All classified directory listings, advertisements, signs, and broadcast commercials, except letterheads and business cards, of corporations, firms, limited liability companies, or partnerships offering landscape architectural services shall include the name and license number of a duly licensed landscape architect providing such services.

          <content>
            <p>§ 43-26-11. Denial or revocation of licenses; other disciplineIn addition to the authority granted in Code Section 43-1-19, the board shall have the authority to refuse to grant a license to an applicant, to revoke the license of a licensee, or to discipline a licensee upon a finding by the board that the applicant or licensee has:
(1)  Been convicted of any felony, crime involving moral turpitude, or crime violating a federal or state law relating to controlled substances or dangerous drugs in the courts of this state, any other state, territory, or country, or in the courts of the United States, including but not limited to a plea of nolo contendere entered to the charge; or(2)  (A) Displayed an inability to practice nursing as a registered professional nurse or licensed undergraduate nurse with reasonable skill and safety due to illness, use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or any other type of material, or as a result of any mental or physical condition.
(B)  In enforcement of this paragraph, the board may, upon reasonable grounds, require a licensee or applicant to submit to a mental or physical examination by a board approved health care professional.  The results of such examination shall be admissible in any hearing before the board, notwithstanding any claim of privilege under a contrary law or rule. Every person who is licensed to practice nursing as a registered professional nurse or licensed undergraduate nurse in this state or who shall file an application shall be deemed to have given such person's consent to submit to such mental or physical examination and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the results in any hearing before the board upon the grounds that the same constitutes a privileged communication.  If a licensee or applicant fails to submit to such an examination when properly directed to do so by the board, unless such failure was due to circumstances beyond that person's control, the board may enter a final order upon proper notice, hearing, and proof of such refusal.  Any licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing under this paragraph shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the board that such person can resume or begin to practice with reasonable skill and safety nursing as a registered professional nurse or licensed undergraduate nurse.

(C)  In enforcement of this paragraph the board may, upon reasonable grounds, obtain any and all records relating to the mental or physical condition of a licensee or applicant, including psychiatric records; and such records shall be admissible in any hearing before the board, notwithstanding any privilege under a contrary rule of law or statute. Every person who is licensed as a registered professional nurse or licensed undergraduate nurse in this state or who shall file an application shall be deemed to have given such person's consent to the board's obtaining any such records and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of such records in any hearing before the board upon the grounds that the same constitute a privileged communication.

(ii)  Such health maintenance activities are provided outside of a hospital or nursing home and are not provided by a medicare-certified home health agency or hospice organization and if alternative sources are available, Medicaid is the payor of last resort; and(iii)  The written plan of care implements the written orders of the attending physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant and specifies the frequency of training and evaluation requirements for the proxy caregiver, including additional training when changes in the written plan of care necessitate added duties for which such proxy caregiver has not previously been trained.

(ii)  "Health maintenance activities" are limited to those activities that, but for a disability, a person could reasonably be expected to do for himself or herself. Such activities are typically taught by a registered professional nurse, but may be taught by an attending physician, advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, or directly to a patient and are part of ongoing care. Health maintenance activities are those activities that do not include complex care such as administration of intravenous medications, central line maintenance, and complex wound care; do not require complex observations or critical decisions; can be safely performed and have reasonably precise, unchanging directions; and have outcomes or results that are reasonably predictable. Health maintenance activities conducted pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered the practice of nursing.

(A)  In enforcement of this paragraph, the board may, upon reasonable grounds, require a licensee or applicant to submit to a mental or physical examination by a board approved health care professional.  The expense of such mental or physical examination shall be borne by the licensee or applicant. The results of such examination shall be admissible in any hearing before the board, notwithstanding any claim of privilege under contrary law or rule. Every person who is licensed to practice practical nursing as a licensed practical nurse in this state, or an applicant for examination, endorsement, or reinstatement, shall be deemed to have given such person's consent to submit to such mental or physical examination and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the results in any hearing before the board upon the grounds that the same constitutes a privileged communication.  If a licensee or applicant fails to submit to such an examination when properly directed to do so by the board, unless such failure was due to circumstances beyond that person's control, the board may enter a final order upon proper notice, hearing, and proof of such refusal.  Any licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing under this paragraph shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the board that such person can resume or begin to practice practical nursing as a licensed practical nurse with reasonable skill and safety; and

(B)  In enforcement of this paragraph, the board may, upon reasonable grounds, obtain any and all records relating to the mental or physical condition of a licensee or applicant, including psychiatric records; such records shall be admissible in any hearing before the board</p>

If the applicant passes the examination, the provisional license shall be valid until the permanent license is issued. If the applicant fails to appear for the examination or if the applicant fails the examination, the provisional license shall become invalid immediately. The board may authorize the issuance of a second provisional license only to an applicant who provides just cause to the board as to why the applicant was unable to appear for the examination.

              <p>The board may suspend the license of an individual who has been certified by a federal agency and reported to the board for nonpayment or default or breach of a repayment or service obligation under any federal educational loan, loan repayment, or service conditional scholarship program. Prior to the suspension, the licensee shall be entitled to notice of the board's intended action and opportunity to appear before the board. A suspension of a license under this Code section is not a contested case under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." A license suspended under this Code section shall not be reinstated or reissued until the individual provides the board a written release issued by the reporting agency stating that the individual is making payments on the loan or satisfying the service requirements in accordance with an agreement approved by the reporting agency. If the individual has continued to meet all other requirements for licensure during the period of suspension, reinstatement of the license shall be automatic upon receipt of the notice and payment of any reinstatement fee which the board may impose.

Upon such appeal, the court shall first determine the claim supporting the intermediate appeal. If the court determines the claim adversely to the petitioner, it shall remand the case to the board which shall then proceed in accordance with Code Section 50-13-17, except that the board shall consider the initial decision of the hearing representative as having been filed with it on the date of remand from the court. If the court determines the claim adversely to the board, it shall treat the initial decision of the agency representative as a final decision of the board and determine all other issues in the case in accordance with Code Section 50-13-19.

The board may, in its discretion, waive the examination provided for in paragraph (2) of Code Section 43-33-12 and may, subject to the provisions under Code Sections 43-33-18 and 43-33-19, grant to a person licensed in another state or territory of the United States full privileges to engage in an equivalent practice authorized by this chapter to any person who has qualifications the board determines to be the substantial equivalent of the qualifications described under paragraph (1) of Code Section 43-33-12 and who is properly licensed under the laws of another state or territory of the United States; provided, however, that the license held by such person was issued after an examination which, in the judgment of the board, is the equivalent of the standards established by the board. In waiving the examination requirement, the board may require additional education or training.

            <p>§ 43-33-16. Expiration, renewal, and restoration of licenses; canceled licenses; continuing education
All licenses shall expire biennially unless renewed. All applications for renewal of a license shall be filed with the division director prior to the expiration date, accompanied by the biennial renewal fee prescribed by the board. A license which has expired for failure of the holder to renew may only be restored after application and payment of the prescribed restoration fee within the time period established by the division director and provided the applicant meets such requirements as the board may establish by rule. Any license which has not been restored within such period following its expiration may not be renewed, restored, or reissued thereafter. The holder of such a canceled license may apply for and obtain a valid license only upon compliance with all relevant requirements for issuance of a new license. The board shall require no less than four hours of continuing education in order to renew any license issued pursuant to this chapter.

            <p>§ 43-33-19. Unlicensed practice as constituting public nuisance; injunctions
The practice of physical therapy is declared to be an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Such practice when engaged in by a person who is not licensed is declared to be harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The board or the district attorney of the circuit where such unlicensed practice exists, or any person or organization having an interest therein, may bring a petition to restrain and enjoin such unlicensed practice in the superior court of the county where such unlicensed person resides. It shall not be necessary in order to obtain an injunction under this Code section to allege or prove that there is no adequate remedy at law, or to allege or prove any special injury.

(B)  In enforcing this paragraph the board may, upon reasonable grounds, require a licensee, certificate holder, permit holder, or applicant to submit to a mental or physical examination by physicians designated by the board.

The results of such examination shall be admissible in any hearing before the board, notwithstanding any claim of privilege under a contrary rule of law or statute, including, but not limited to, Code Section 24-5-501. Every person who shall accept the privilege of practicing a profession regulated under this chapter or who shall file an application for a license to practice a profession regulated under this chapter in this state shall be deemed to have given his or her consent to submit to such mental or physical examination and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the results in any hearing before the board, upon the grounds that the same constitutes a privileged communication. If a licensee, certificate holder, or permit holder or applicant fails to submit to such an examination when properly directed to do so by the board, unless such failure was due to circumstances beyond his or her control, the board may enter a final order upon proper notice, hearing, and proof of such refusal. Any licensee, certificate holder, permit holder, or applicant who is prohibited from practicing pursuant to this chapter under this paragraph shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the board that he or she can resume or begin practice pursuant to this chapter with reasonable skill and safety to patients.

Any person properly conducting an investigation on behalf of the board shall have access to and may examine any writing, document, or other material, except that as to which privilege has not been denied or deemed waived by this chapter, and which is deemed by the chairperson of the board, or vice chairperson if the chairperson is not available, to be related to the fitness of any licensee, certificate holder, permit holder, or applicant to practice pursuant to this chapter. The executive director or the chairperson of the board, or vice chairperson if the chairperson is not available, may issue subpoenas to compel such access. When a subpoena is disobeyed, the board may apply to the superior court of the county where the person to whom the subpoena is issued resides for an order requiring obedience. Failure to comply with such order shall be punishable as for contempt of court. The results of any investigations whatsoever shall be reported only to the board, and the records of such investigations shall be kept by the board; no part of any such record shall be released for any purpose other than a hearing before the board and as provided in Chapter 34A of this title; nor shall such records be subject to subpoena. The board shall be authorized to release records that are not otherwise confidential or privileged only to another state or federal enforcement agency or lawful licensing authority and such release shall not alter the confidential or privileged nature of the documents.</p>

            <p>§ 43-34-9. Prior notice and hearing in disciplinary proceedings; proceedings as constituting contested cases; subpoenas; failure to appear
Proceedings before the board wherein a licensee's, certificate holder's, or permit holder's right to practice pursuant to this chapter in this state is terminated, suspended, or limited or wherein a public reprimand is administered shall require prior notice to the licensee and an opportunity for hearing; and such proceedings shall be considered contested cases within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." Neither refusal of a license, certificate, or permit nor a private reprimand nor a letter of concern shall be considered a contested case within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 50, and notice and hearing within the meaning of such chapter shall not be required; provided, however, that the applicant shall be allowed to appear before the board, if the applicant so requests, prior to the board making a final decision regarding the issuance of the license, certificate, or permit. The power to subpoena as set forth in Chapter 13 of Title 50 shall include the power to subpoena any book, writing, paper, or document. If any licensee, certificate holder, or permit holder fails to appear at any hearing after reasonable notice, the board may proceed to hear the evidence against such licensee, certificate holder, or permit holder and take action as if such licensee, certificate holder, or permit holder had been present.

                <p>(A) Any person who wishes to obtain the right to practice medicine in this state and who was not, prior to March 16, 1970, registered or licensed to practice medicine, either by the State Board of Medical Examiners or the State Board of Examiners in Osteopathy, shall, before it shall be lawful for him or her to practice medicine in this state, make application to the board through the executive director, upon such forms and in such manner as shall be adopted and prescribed by the board, and shall obtain from the board a license to practice medicine. Any person who practices medicine without first having obtained a license shall be deemed to have violated this article. All applicants for a license to practice medicine or for a renewal of any such license which has been revoked shall furnish the board with evidence of good moral character. Applications from candidates to practice medicine or surgery in any of its branches shall be accompanied by proof that the applicant is a graduate of some legally incorporated medical school or osteopathic medical school.(B)  The board by rule or regulation may establish standards for evaluating, inspecting, and approving any medical school or osteopathic medical school. The evaluation procedure may include consideration of reports from any outside agency having expertise in medical school or osteopathic medical school evaluation; provided, however, that the board shall make the final decision on approval of medical schools and osteopathic medical schools. Nothing contained in this Code section shall prevent the approval of medical schools outside of the United States or the licensing of graduates of medical schools outside of the United States if such schools and their graduates comply with the standards established in this Code section and by rule of the board.</p>

Any qualified applicant who is an alien, except for graduates of accredited Canadian medical schools as approved by the board, must have resided in the United States for one year.

            <p>§ 43-34-62. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Acupuncture" means a form of therapy developed from traditional and modern Oriental concepts for health care that employs Oriental medical techniques, treatment, and adjunctive therapies for the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of health and the prevention of disease.

(2)  "Auricular (ear) detoxification therapy" means the insertion of disposable acupuncture needles into the five auricular acupuncture points stipulated by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association protocol for the sole purpose of treatment of chemical dependency.

(3)  "Board" means the Georgia Composite Medical Board.

(4)  "Practice of acupuncture" means the insertion of disposable acupuncture needles and the application of moxibustion to specific areas of the human body based upon Oriental medical principles as a therapeutic modality. Dry needling is a technique of the practice of acupuncture. Adjunctive therapies within the scope of acupuncture may include manual, mechanical, herbal, thermal, electrical, and electromagnetic treatment and the recommendation of dietary guidelines and exercise, but only if such treatments, recommendations, and exercises are based on concepts of traditional Oriental medicine and are directly related to acupuncture therapy.

This would allow qualified physicians approved by the Patient Qualification Review Board created by Code Section 43-34-124 to provide the drug on a compassionate basis to seriously ill persons suffering from the severe side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatment and to persons suffering from glaucoma who are not responding to conventional treatment, which persons would otherwise have no lawful access to it.

            <p>§ 43-34-191. Findings of General Assembly
The General Assembly finds that the practice of orthotics and prosthetics in this state is an allied health profession recognized by the American Medical Association, with educational standards established by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs. The increasing population of elderly and physically challenged individuals who need orthotic and prosthetic services requires that the orthotic and prosthetic professions be regulated to ensure the provision of high-quality services and devices. The people of this state deserve the best care available and will benefit from the assurance of initial and ongoing professional competence of the orthotists and prosthetists practicing in this state. The practice of orthotics and prosthetics serves to improve and enhance the lives of individuals with disabilities by enabling them to resume productive lives following serious illness, injury, or trauma. Unregulated dispensing of orthotic and prosthetic care does not adequately meet the needs or serve the interests of the public. In keeping with requirements imposed on similar health disciplines, licensure of the orthotic and prosthetic professions will help ensure the health and safety of consumers, as well as maximize their functional abilities and productivity levels.

This article is enacted for the purpose of safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for state administrative control, supervision, and regulation of the practice of providing cosmetic laser services. It is the intention of the General Assembly that cosmetic laser services be made available and affordable to the people of this state in a safe, reliable manner. Unregulated cosmetic laser services do not adequately meet the needs or serve the interests of the public. Licensure of those performing cosmetic laser services and required education and training of such practitioners will help ensure the health and safety of consumers. The practice of providing cosmetic laser services is declared to be affected with the public interest; and this article shall be liberally construed so as to accomplish the purpose stated in this Code section.

            <p>§ 43-34-247. Petition to restrain or enjoin unlicensed cosmetic laser practitioner
The practice of providing cosmetic laser services is declared to be an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Such practice when engaged in by a person who is not licensed as a cosmetic laser practitioner or otherwise licensed to practice a profession which is permitted under law to perform cosmetic laser services is declared to be harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The board or the district attorney of the circuit where such unlicensed practice exists, or any person or organization having an interest therein, may bring a petition to restrain and enjoin such unlicensed practice in the superior court of the county where such unlicensed person resides. It shall not be necessary in order to obtain an injunction under this Code section to allege or prove that there is no adequate remedy at law, or to allege or prove any special injury.

              <p>This article is enacted for the purpose of safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for state administrative control, supervision, and regulation of pain management clinics. It is the intention of the General Assembly that people be able to obtain appropriate and safe medical care to treat conditions in which the control of pain is an element. However, the illegal and improper distribution of controlled substances is a growing problem in this state. Licensure and regulation of pain management clinics will better protect the public from criminal activities associated with the illegal distribution of controlled substances as well as provide for a safer place for people to obtain appropriate medical treatment by requiring certain minimum training of practitioners and by the regulation of pain management clinics.</p>

            <p>§ 43-35-17. Practice without license deemed public nuisance; injunctions
The practice of podiatric medicine is declared to be an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public.  Such practice when engaged in by a person who is not licensed under the provisions of this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The board, or the district attorney of the district where such nuisance exists, may bring a petition to restrain and enjoin such unlicensed practice in the appropriate court of the county where such unlicensed person resides.  It shall not be necessary in order to obtain an injunction under this Code section to allege or prove that there is no adequate remedy at law.

The required bond shall be executed in favor of the state, in the amount of $25,000.00, with a surety company authorized to do business in this state and conditioned to pay damages not to exceed the amount of such bond to any person aggrieved by any act of the principal named in such bond, which act is in violation of this chapter and would be grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation of a license under Code Section 43-38-11. Immediately upon the granting of a license, such bond shall be filed with the division director by the licensee and shall be approved by the division director as to form and as to the solvency of the surety. The prospective licensee may file the required bond with the division director prior to the granting of a license for the division director's approval as provided in this Code section. In lieu of the required bond, a prospective licensee may submit to the board evidence of a policy of liability insurance in an amount of not less than $1 million insuring such prospective licensee against personal liability for damages arising out of acts of the insured or his employees. No licensee shall cancel or cause to be canceled a bond or liability insurance policy issued pursuant to this Code section unless the board is so informed in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery at least 30 days prior to the proposed cancellation. In lieu of the required bond or liability insurance policy, the prospective licensee may submit a net worth affidavit, prepared using standard accounting procedures, which affidavit indicates that the prospective licensee has a net worth of more than $50,000.00.

          <content>
            <p>§ 43-39-7. Practicing without a license; use of title; exceptionsA person who is not licensed under this chapter shall not practice psychology, shall not use the title "psychologist," and shall not imply that he or she is a psychologist.  If any person shall practice psychology or hold himself or herself out as being engaged in the practice of psychology and shall not then possess in full force a valid license to practice psychology under the laws of this state, such person shall be in violation of this chapter.  The following are exceptions:
(1)  Nothing in this chapter shall require licensure for a person who is certified as a school psychologist by the Professional Standards Commission while that person is working as an employee in an educational institution recognized by the State Board of Examiners of Psychologists as meeting satisfactory accreditation standards, provided that no fees are charged directly to clients or through a third party;

(2)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the teaching of psychology or the conduct of psychological research, provided that such teaching or research does not involve the delivery or supervision of direct psychological services to individuals or groups of individuals by an unlicensed person.  Any person holding a doctoral degree in psychology while working as an employee in a research laboratory, college, or university recognized by the board as meeting satisfactory accreditation standards may use the title "psychologist" in conjunction with activities permitted by this paragraph, provided that no fees are charged directly to clients or through a third party;

(3)  Nothing in this chapter shall require licensure for a person who was engaged in the practice of psychology as an employee of an agency or department of the state government, any of its political subdivisions, or community service boards as defined in Code Section 37-2-2 either prior to July 1, 1996, at a state intermediate care or skilled care facility for persons with mental retardation or prior to July 1, 1997, at any other facilities or offices of the entities previously mentioned, but only when that person is engaged in that practice as an employee of such entities;

(4)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the activities and services of a person in the employ of or serving for an established and recognized religious organization, provided that the title "psychologist" is not used by a person not licensed and that the person does not imply that he or she is a psychologist;

(5)  Persons who hold a doctoral degree in psychology may practice under the supervision of a licensed psychologist in order to obtain the experience required for licensure;

(6)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit any person from engaging in the lawful practice of medicine, nursing, professional counseling, social work, and marriage and family therapy, as provided for under other state law, provided that such person shall not use the title "psychologist" nor imply that he or she is a psychologist;

(7)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent students, trainees, or assistants from engaging in activities defined as the practice of psychology, provided such persons are under the direct supervision and responsibility of a licensed psychologist and the student, trainee, or assistant does not represent himself or herself to be a psychologist. The board shall establish rules and regulations for the supervision of persons exempted under this paragraph;

(8)  An individual licensed to practice psychology in another jurisdiction may practice psychology in Georgia without applying for a license, so long as the requirements for a license in the other jurisdiction are equal to or exceed the requirements for licensure in Georgia, and the psychologist limits that person's practice in Georgia to no more than 30 days per year, as defined in the rules and regulations of the board; and

(9)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting any person licensed under Chapter 10A of this title from providing services he or she is authorized to perform under Chapter 10A of this title, including, but not limited to, administering and interpreting educational and vocational tests; functional assessments; interest inventories; tests that evaluate marital and family functioning; mental health symptom screening and assessment instruments that evaluate emotional, mental, behavioral, and interpersonal problems or conditions including substance use, health, and disability; or any other assessments or tests which the person is qualified to employ by virtue of his or her education, training, or experience within the scope of practice of professional counselors. The Georgia Composite Board of Professional Counselors, Social Workers, and Marriage and Family Therapists shall have sole authority to regulate assessment and testing performed by persons licensed under Chapter 10A of this tit</p>

              <p>The board may issue a provisional license to an applicant for a permanent license.  The provisional license may be granted to an individual who has passed all written examinations and completed all other requirements for permanent license except for the postdoctoral supervised work experience requirement and the oral examination.  Provisional licensure will expire in 24 months unless the board grants an exception, or in the event of the granting of a permanent license, whichever occurs first.  The provisional license shall not be renewable.  An individual who is licensed under this subsection is restricted to the stipulations of the supervised work experience requirement. Provisional licensure will be granted only to an individual who is in the process of completing the postdoctoral supervised work experience requirement and is subject to revocation if the board determines that the requirements of the supervised work experience are not being satisfactorily met.  The revocation of a provisional license shall not be considered a contested case within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," but a holder of a provisional license shall have a right to appear before the board.

The board is authorized to bring an action to enjoin any person, firm, or corporation who, without being licensed to practice psychology by the board, engages in the practice of psychology as regulated by this chapter. The proceeding shall be filed in the county in which such person resides or in the county where the firm or corporation maintains a principal office. If it shall be made to appear that such person, firm, or corporation is practicing psychology without a license, the injunction shall be issued and such person, firm, or corporation shall be permanently enjoined from practicing psychology throughout the state. It shall not be necessary, in order to obtain the equitable relief described in this Code section, for the board to allege and prove there is no adequate remedy at law. It is declared that such unlicensed activities are a menace and a nuisance and are dangerous to public health, safety, and welfare.

There is created the Georgia State Board of Architects and Interior Designers, which shall be composed of nine appointed members. Six of the members shall be registered architects who hold a current license in this state and who shall be residents of this state. Two members shall be registered interior designers who are residents of this state and who have been interior designers for at least ten years immediately preceding the appointment and who shall have passed an examination approved by the board. One member shall be a resident of this state and shall have no connection whatsoever with the practice or profession of architecture or interior design.

          <content>
            <p>§ 43-4-12. Certificate of registration; registration required; professional development requirements for renewal
A certificate of registration as a registered architect shall be valid for two years and shall be renewed biennially as provided by rule of the board. It is unlawful to identify oneself as being able to practice architecture in this state without a current and valid registration in this state. An applicant for a renewal of a certificate of registration shall meet such professional development requirements as the board may require by rule or regulation. Such rule or regulation shall describe professional development activities acceptable to the board and the form of documentation of such activities required by the board. The board shall be authorized to waive the professional development requirement in cases of hardship, disability, age, illness, or under such other circumstances as the board deems appropriate. Failure to meet the minimum qualifications for renewal of a license shall be grounds for denial of a renewal application.

Each written agreement shall provide:
(A)  For procedures to be followed in the event of the out-of-state broker's performing any of the acts of a broker on real property located in Georgia;

(B)  How the brokers will divide any earned commissions;

(C)  That any listing or property management agreement for Georgia real property in which the out-of-state broker will participate shall be in the name of the Georgia broker;

(D)  That the out-of-state broker shall conduct negotiations with any client of a Georgia broker only with the express permission of the Georgia broker;

(E)  That any advertisement by any means of Georgia real property shall identify the listing Georgia broker;

(F)  That any contracts, agreements, or offers on Georgia real property shall clearly identify the Georgia broker and the out-of-state broker with the statement that the out-of-state broker is not licensed by the Georgia Real Estate Commission; that said contract, agreement, or offer shall be construed under Georgia law; and that the superior courts of this state shall have jurisdiction over any actions which may be brought aga</p>

            <p>§ 43-40-14. Power of commission to issue, revoke, or suspend licenses and censure licensees; power to enter contracts; retention of funds
The commission shall have the full power to regulate the issuance of licenses, to revoke or suspend licenses issued under this chapter, and to censure licensees. The commission is authorized to enter into such contracts as are necessary to carry out its duties under this chapter; provided, however, the commission may enter into contracts to assist it in the conduct of investigations and examinations of brokers' trust accounts authorized by this chapter only whenever it needs special legal or accounting expertise or other extraordinary circumstances exist. Whenever the commission contracts to perform such investigation or examination of trust account functions, any such contractor working on an investigation or examination of a trust account authorized by this chapter shall be under the supervision of the commission or an employee of the commission. Any contractor used by the commission shall be knowledgeable in the work area for which such contractor is retained. A contractor shall not be empowered to determine the disposition of any investigation or examination of a trust account nor to make any discretionary decision that the commission is authorized by law to make. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission is authorized to retain all funds received as collection fees for use in defraying the cost of collection of fees required under this chapter. Any such funds not expended for this purpose in the fiscal year in which they are generated shall be deposited in the state treasury; provided, however, that nothing in this Code section shall be construed so as to allow the commission to retain any funds required by the Constitution to be paid into the state treasury; provided, further, that the commission shall comply with all provisions of Part 1 of Article 4 of Chapter 12 of Title 45, the "Budget Act," except Code Section 45-12-92, prior to expending any such funds.

Following any such hearing, the commission in its discretion may impose upon such licensee any disciplinary action or sanction permitted by this chapter or impose no disciplinary action or sanction. If a licensee fails to make a written request for a hearing during the 60 day period after the conviction, then the commission, upon discovery of the conviction, shall have the option of revoking the licensee's license without the licensee being entitled to a hearing or the commission in its discretion may impose upon such licensee any other disciplinary action or sanction permitted by this chapter or impose no disciplinary action or sanction.</p>

A broker who does not accept trust funds in real estate brokerage transactions is not required to maintain a designated trust or escrow account; provided, however, that if a broker does not maintain such a trust or escrow account and later receives trust funds in a real estate brokerage transaction, such broker must open the designated trust or escrow account required by this subsection within one business day of the receipt of such trust funds.</p>

            <p>§ 43-40-21. Violations involving real estate accounts; report to Attorney General; injunctions; appointment of receiver
Whenever it shall appear to the commission from any examination or report provided by the laws of this state that a broker has failed to comply with Code Section 43-40-20 or if any broker or the officers, members, or partners of any firm licensed as a real estate broker shall refuse to submit their books, papers, and affairs to the inspection of any examiner, the commission shall have reason to conclude that the trust account of such broker is in an unsafe or unsound condition; and the commission shall immediately submit a complete report of all information available to it to the Attorney General. An action may be brought by this state to enjoin such broker from engaging in or continuing such violation or doing any act or acts in furtherance thereof. In any such action, an order or judgment may be entered awarding such preliminary or final injunctions as may be deemed proper. In addition to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of a restraining order or injunction, the court in which such action is brought shall have power and jurisdiction to impound and appoint a receiver for the property and business of the defendant, including books, papers, documents, and records pertaining thereto, or as much thereof as the court may deem reasonably necessary to prevent violations of the law or injury to the public through, or by means of, the use of such property and business. Such receiver, when so appointed and qualified, shall have such powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up, and liquidation of such property and business as shall, from time to time, be conferred upon such receiver by the court.

              <p>After the commission has opened an investigation as authorized by Code Section 43-40-27, the commission shall be authorized to obtain conviction data with respect to an applicant or licensee who is the subject of such investigation. The commission may require any applicant or licensee who is the subject of an investigation conducted pursuant to Code Section 43-40-27 and who has been convicted of, pled nolo contendere to, or been granted first offender treatment upon being charged with any criminal offense other than a traffic violation or any traffic violation that involved driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, homicide or feticide by vehicle, fleeing the scene of an accident, attempting to elude a police officer, or impersonating a law enforcement officer to submit to the commission two complete sets of classifiable fingerprints of the applicant or licensee. Upon receipt thereof, the commission shall submit both sets of fingerprints to the Georgia Crime Information Center which shall promptly transmit one set of fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a search of bureau records and an appropriate report. The Georgia Crime Information Center shall retain the other set of fingerprints and promptly conduct a search of its own records and records to which it has access. The Georgia Crime Information Center shall notify the commission in writing of any derogatory finding, including, but not limited to, any conviction data regarding the fingerprint records check or if there is no such finding. All conviction data received by the commission shall be used by it for the exclusive purpose of carrying out its responsibilities under this chapter, shall not be a public record, shall be privileged, and shall not be disclosed to any other person or agency except as provided in Code Section 43-40-27.

              <p>If an individual applicant proposes to engage in residential or general contracting in the individual's own name or a trade name where the individual is doing business as a sole proprietorship, the license shall be issued only to that individual. Where an applicant under this chapter is seeking issuance of a residential or general contractor license on behalf and for the benefit of a business organization seeking to engage in residential or general contracting as a business organization, the application for a license under this chapter must be submitted by and through an individual qualifying agent for such business organization or entity and expressly on behalf of such business organization or entity. In such case, the license shall be issued to the individual qualifying agent and to the affiliated business organization or entity on whose behalf the application was made. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, or association to operate a business organization or entity engaged in the business of residential or general contracting without first obtaining a license from the appropriate division after the effective date of the licensing requirements as specified in subsection</p>

A business organization may allow more than one person to act as a qualifying agent for such organization, subject to each such individual qualifying agent having successfully satisfied the requirements for issuance of a license under this chapter and having obtained issuance of such a license by the appropriate division.

The submission of such application shall serve to maintain the licensed status of the business organization pending and subject to approval of such application by the appropriate division; provided that, should such application be denied by that division, then, after passage of the 120 day period, the business organization shall cease to be considered licensed as a residential or a general contractor unless and until a new application is submitted and approved by the appropriate division. In such circumstance, the affected business organization may not thereafter engage in residential or general contracting until a new qualifying agent is employed, unless the appropriate division has granted a temporary nonrenewable license to the financially responsible officer, the president or chief executive officer, a partner, or, in the case of a limited partnership, the general partner, who thereafter shall assume all responsibilities of a qualifying agent for the business organization or entity.

A qualifying agent is not responsible for his or her predecessor's actions, but is responsible, even after a change in status, for matters for which he or she was responsible while in a particular status. Further, nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as a basis for imposition of civil liability against an individual qualifying agent by any owner or other third party claimant beyond the liability that would otherwise exist legally or contractually apart from and independent of the individual's status as a qualifying agent.

              <p>As a matter of public policy, any contract entered into on or after July 1, 2008, for the performance of work for which a residential contractor or general contractor license is required by this chapter and not otherwise exempted under this chapter and which is between an owner and a contractor who does not have a valid and current license required for such work in accordance with this chapter shall be unenforceable in law or in equity by the unlicensed contractor. For purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be considered unlicensed only if the contractor was unlicensed on the effective date of the original contract for the work, if stated therein, or, if not stated, the date the last party to the contract executed such contract, if stated therein. If the contract does not establish such a date, the contractor shall be considered unlicensed only if the contractor was unlicensed on the first date upon which the contractor provided labor, services, or materials under the contract. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if a contract is rendered unenforceable under this subsection, no lien or bond claim shall exist in favor of the unlicensed contractor for any labor, services, or materials provided under the contract or any amendment thereto. This subsection shall not affect the rights of parties other than the unlicensed contractor to enforce contract, lien, or bond remedies. This subsection shall not affect the obligations of a surety that has provided a bond on behalf of an unlicensed contractor. It shall not be a defense to any claim on a bond or indemnity agreement that the principal or indemnitor is unlicensed for purposes of this subsection.</p>

In so doing, such person may act as his or her own contractor personally providing direct supervision and management of all work not performed by licensed contractors.

Further, such person may not delegate the responsibility to directly supervise and manage all or any part of the work relating thereto to any other person unless that person is licensed under this chapter and the work being performed is within the scope of that person's license.

              <p>The spouse of any member of the military who resides in this state due to the assignment of the military spouse and who holds a license or certification from another state the training, experience, and testing for which substantially meet or exceed the Georgia requirements to obtain a license or certification as a residential-light commercial contractor shall be entitled to apply to the licensing board for the immediate issuance of such a license. In order to qualify under this subsection, an applicant shall make application not later than 180 days after his or her relocation to the State of Georgia. Such application shall be in such form and shall require such documentation as the division director shall determine. A committee composed of the division director, members of the Governor's Office of Workforce Development, and members of the relevant divisions of the licensing board representing the profession for which the applicant is seeking a license, with a chairperson appointed by the Governor from among the membership of the committee, shall determine whether the training, experience, and testing for obtaining a license in the relevant foreign state substantially meet or exceed the requirements to obtain the professional licenses provided in this state. If the applicant satisfies the requirements of this Code section, the division director shall direct the appropriate division to issue the license, and such division shall immediately issue such license; provided, however, that the applicant shall satisfy all financial and insurance requirements for the issuance of such license. This Code section shall only apply to the initial issuance of a license. After the initial issuance of a license, the licensee shall be subject to any provisions relating to the renewal of the license applicable to all licensees.

          <content>
            <p>§ 43-45-8. General powers and duties of commissionThe commission is authorized and required to:
(1)  Make such reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary to protect the interest, health, and safety of the public and to ensure the efficiency of licensees, operators, and registered employees to carry out this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall not be effective until a public hearing shall have been granted and notification of such a hearing has been made to all licensees and certified operators;

(2)  Provide for an appropriate and written examination for applicants and any other appropriate means of examination for applicants. The frequency of such examination shall be at the discretion of the commission, based upon the number of applications received, but not less than two such examinations shall be held annually. The commission shall give one examination per phase of structural pest control for one fee if the applicant seems to qualify. The examination fee shall be in an amount established by the commission for each applicant who makes application to take the examination to become a certified household pest control operator, wood-destroying organism control operator, or fumigator. An examination may be taken for the payment of one fee; and, in case the applicant shall not be certified, he or she shall have the right to take the examination again at the next scheduled examination, upon the payment of an additional fee in an amount established by the commission. In case certification is again denied, the applicant must wait a full year before reapplication is made. Thereafter, one full year must elapse before subsequent application may be made;

(3)  Make an annual report to the Governor of the activities, expenditures, receipts, and other matters pertinent to the operation of the commission, a copy of which shall be filed by the Commissioner and the commission;

(4)  Issue licenses to each place of business of each business entity qualifying under this chapter.  Such licenses shall be renewable biennially and the license fee shall be in an amount established by the commission.  In addition to the license fee per se, the commission is authorized to establish a research fee on each license in an amount sufficient to provide a minimum of $30,000.00 per year and up to $50,000.00 per year for the purpose of supporting the work of a research position in urban pest control at the University of Georgia.  As a source of information for considering the amount of the research fee to be established, the commission shall be furnished within 30 days of the end of each fiscal year by the chairman of the Division of Entomology at the University of Georgia with a statement of the total costs associated with the research position for the preceding year and a description of the urban research projects to be conducted over the following two fiscal years.  The commission shall advise the chairman of the Entomology Division at the University of Georgia on the projects proposed to be conducted; however, the final selection of projects shall be the sole responsibility of the chairman of the entomology division.  Information provided to the commission on costs associated with the position shall be for advisory purposes only and the commission shall be solely responsible for establishment and collection of the research fee within the limits established above and for transferring such fees to the University of Georgia.  If the University of Georgia discontinues such research position at any time, the commission shall discontinue its collection of the research fee and any unexpended funds held by the commission shall be transferred to the state treasury.

(5)  Issue certificates, certifying the qualification of operators, to those persons qualifying under this chapter. The certification fee shall be in an amount established by the commission; such certification shall be renewable biennially unless revoked or canceled for cause, subject to reeducation or such other requirements as the commission may impose by regulation to ensure that certified operators continue to meet the needs of changing technology and to assure a continuing level of competence and ability to operate safely and properly;

(6)  Issue certificates of registration to employees under this chapter. The secretary shall collect for such registration a fee in an amount established by the commission for each such registration. The commission is authorized to require a fee in an amount established by the commission for each change, cancellation, renewal, or issuance of a duplicate registration card;

(7)  Adopt a seal and alter the same at the pleasure of the commission;

(8)  Hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, and compel the production of documents and papers as shall be necessary in the performance of the duties of the commission;

The order shall contain or be accompanied by a notice of opportunity for a hearing which states that a hearing must be petitioned for in writing within ten days of the service of the order.  If a hearing is petitioned for within such ten-day period, the administrative order is stayed pending a final decision by the hearing officer.  Upon receipt of a written petition for a hearing, the Commissioner shall schedule the hearing before a hearing officer appointed by the Commissioner, unless postponed by mutual consent, within 30 days of the receipt by the Commissioner of the petition. The Commissioner shall give the person petitioning for the hearing notice of the time and place of the hearing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the address specified in the petition for a hearing at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing.

Each completed application for a permanent license shall be reviewed by the appropriate division, which may deny licensure for any good reason under this chapter. Any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, each applicant for a license pursuant to the provisions of this Code section shall agree in the application that if the applicant makes a false statement on the application or if the criminal record check returned from the Georgia Crime Information Center or from the Federal Bureau of Investigation reveals a conviction of or an entry of a plea of nolo contendere to a crime involving the use of violence, a used motor vehicle, or illegal drugs; tax evasion or failure to pay taxes; any crime involving the illegal use or possession of a dangerous weapon; or any crime involving moral turpitude, then the division shall be authorized to suspend the license without a prior hearing. The divisions shall each meet as needed, in their discretion. The board shall meet at least once each quarter and upon the call of the board chairperson for any special sessions.

            <p>§ 43-49-1. Purpose of chapter
The purpose of this chapter is to identify all used, rebuilt, or reconditioned watches by requiring them to be marked "secondhand," so as to safeguard the public and prevent the public from being misled when purchasing used, rebuilt, or reconditioned watches and to prevent them from being sold as new watches.

(2)  Its case serial numbers or movement numbers or other distinguishing numbers or identification marks shall be erased, defaced, removed, altered, or covered; or

(3)  Its movements are more than five years old and it has been repaired by any person or persons, including the vendor, notwithstanding that it may have been returned either through an exchange or for credit to the original vendor.

(1)  "Athletic injury" means any injury sustained by a person as a result of such person's participation in exercises, sports, games, or recreational activities, or any activities requiring physical strength, agility, flexibility, range of motion, speed, or stamina without respect to where or how the injury occurs. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to expand the scope of practice of an athletic trainer beyond the determination of the advising and consenting physician as provided for in paragraph (2) of this Code section.

(2)  "Athletic trainer" means a person with specific qualifications, as set forth in Code Sections 43-5-7 and 43-5-8 who, upon the advice and consent of a physician, carries out the practice of prevention, recognition, evaluation, management, disposition, treatment, or rehabilitation of athletic injuries; and, in carrying out these functions, the athletic trainer is authorized to use physical modalities, such as heat, light, sound, cold, electricity, or mechanical devices related to prevention, recognition, evaluation, management, disposition, rehabilitation, and treatment. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to require licensure of elementary or secondary school teachers, coaches, or authorized volunteers who do not hold themselves out to the public as athletic trainers.

(3)  "Board" means the Georgia Board of Athletic Trainers.

              <p>A veterinary assistant must clearly identify himself or herself as such in order to ensure that he or she is not mistaken by the public as a licensed veterinarian or licensed veterinary technician. This may be accomplished, for example, by the wearing of an appropriate name tag. Any time the veterinary assistant's name appears in a professional setting, his or her status must be shown as "veterinary assistant."
