          <p>Any patient admitted to an evaluating facility may apply to the chief medical officer of that facility for transfer at his own expense to any other approved evaluating facility. If the evaluating facility to which transfer is requested agrees to admit the patient and if the patient is able to pay for evaluation at such facility, he shall be transferred forthwith. In such case, Code Section 37-7-64 shall apply; and the time periods specified shall be counted from the date of admission to the evaluating facility to which the patient is transferred. Notice of the transfer shall be given to the patient's representatives; to the person who filed the original petition, if any; if the patient was admitted to the evaluating facility from an emergency receiving facility under Code Section 37-7-43, to the physician or psychologist who executed the certificate or to the court which issued the order pursuant to Code Section 37-7-41; if the patient was under criminal charges of which the facility received written notification, by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the law enforcement agency originally having custody of the patient; and, if the patient was admitted to the evaluating facility under Code Section 37-7-62, to the court that ordered the evaluation.</p>
