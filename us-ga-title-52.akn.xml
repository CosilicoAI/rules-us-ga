            <p>§ 52-1-2. Legislative findings and declaration of policy; public trust doctrine for tidewaters
The General Assembly finds and declares that the State of Georgia became the owner of the beds of all tidewaters within the jurisdiction of the State of Georgia as successor to the Crown of England and by the common law. The State of Georgia continues to hold title to the beds of all tidewaters within the state, except where title in a private party can be traced to a valid Crown or state grant which explicitly conveyed the beds of such tidewaters.  The General Assembly further finds that the State of Georgia, as sovereign, is trustee of the rights of the people of the state to use and enjoy all tidewaters which are capable of use for fishing, passage, navigation, commerce, and transportation, pursuant to the common law public trust doctrine. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the protection of tidewaters for use by the state and its citizens has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and, consequently, is properly a matter for regulation under the police powers of the state.  The General Assembly further finds and declares that structures located upon tidewaters which are used as places of habitation, dwelling, sojournment, or residence interfere with the state's proprietary interest or the public trust, or both, and must be removed to ensure the rights of the state and the people of the State of Georgia to the use and enjoyment of such tidewaters.  It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this article to protect the tidewaters of the state by authorizing the commissioner of natural resources to remove or require removal of certain structures from such tidewaters in accordance with the procedures and within the timetable set forth in this article.

          <content>
            <p>§ 52-1-5. Order for removal of structures; service and posting of order
Whenever the commissioner determines that any structure as defined in this article exists, the commissioner may issue an order directed "TO ALL PERSONS IN POSSESSION OR CLAIMING OWNERSHIP OF THIS STRUCTURE." The order shall describe the structure in reasonable detail, shall set forth the unlawful nature of the structure, and shall order that the structure be removed within a reasonable time after the order becomes final to be prescribed in such order. Any order issued by the commissioner under this article shall be signed by the commissioner.  Any such order shall become final unless any person in possession of the structure or any person claiming ownership of or an interest in the structure requests in writing a hearing pursuant to Code Section 52-1-6. The order shall apprise the person or persons of their right to request a hearing and of the procedures necessary to obtain a hearing pursuant to Code Section 52-1-6.  The order, in all cases, shall be served by initially publishing the same once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper printed and published in the county in which the structure is located or in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the structure is located.  The order shall then be served by a peace officer upon any person of suitable age and discretion found in possession of the structure or, if no such person is found in possession of the structure, the peace officer shall securely post the order in a conspicuous place on the structure.  Any order so posted must be protected from the weather by encasing same in a weatherproof, transparent material.  The date of service shall be stated within the order. The return of the service signed by the peace officer and filed in the office of the commissioner, stating that a copy of such order was served either upon a person of suitable age and discretion in possession of the structure personally or that no such person was found in possession of the structure and that a copy of the order was posted in a conspicuous place on the structure in accordance with this Code section, shall be sufficient evidence as to the service of such person in possession; provided, however, that where the address of the person or persons claiming ownership of the structure is known, a copy of such order shall be mailed to such persons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery as part of the service process during the period of time that the order is being published in the newspaper.

The hearing before the administrative law judge shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," and the rules and regulations adopted by the board pursuant thereto. Unless waived by the commissioner, any person seeking a hearing has the burden of going forward with evidence regarding possession or ownership of or an interest in the structure, and the administrative law judge shall take evidence and hear arguments on this issue and thereafter make a ruling on this issue before continuing with the hearing. Any decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute the final decision of the board, and any party to the hearing, including the commissioner, shall have the right of judicial review thereof in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50. The hearing and review procedure provided for the petitioner in this Code section is to the exclusion of all other means of hearing or review.

            <p>§ 52-1-7. Seizure and removal of structures; notice; sale or disposal
Whenever any order issued by the commissioner pursuant to Code Section 52-1-5 becomes final or whenever any order adverse to the owner or possessor of a structure issued by the administrative law judge pursuant to Code Section 52-1-6 becomes final by being unappealed or affirmed upon appeal, the structure shall be deemed contraband.  Upon the structure's becoming contraband, the commissioner or his duly authorized agents shall seize and remove said structure and may sell or dispose of such structure in such manner as the commissioner may direct; provided, however, that prior to such seizure the commissioner shall securely post a notice in a conspicuous place on the structure and, if the address of any person or persons claiming ownership of or any person or persons in possession of the structure is known, the commissioner shall mail a copy of such notice to such person or persons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery informing such person or persons claiming ownership of or in possession of the structure that such structure is considered contraband as a matter of law and that unless the structure is removed within 30 days of the date of the notice, the commissioner, through his duly appointed agents, shall seize and remove said structure and may sell or dispose of such structure in such manner as the commissioner may direct.  Any such notice so posted must be protected from the weather by encasing same in a weatherproof, transparent material.  In the event the commissioner sells the structure or the materials of such structure, he may credit and retain the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal and disposal of the structure and any remaining balance shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the general fund.

            <p>§ 52-1-31. Legislative findings and declaration of policy
The General Assembly finds and declares that by the common law the citizens of this state have an inherent right to use as highways all navigable streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year and that this right of use extends to the entire surface of the stream or river from bank to bank.  The General Assembly further finds that the common law regarding such right of use has not been modified by statute nor is it incompatible with the federal or state constitutions. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that ensuring the right of use by all the citizens of this state of navigable streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year as highways has more than local significance, is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and, consequently, is properly a matter for regulation under the police powers of the state.  The General Assembly further finds and declares that structures located upon navigable streams and rivers which are used as places of habitation, dwelling, sojournment, or residence interfere with the citizens' right to use the entire surface of such streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year from bank to bank as highways and must be removed to ensure the rights of the citizens of this state to such usage.  It is declared to be a policy of this state and the intent of this article to ensure such rights of the citizens of this state by authorizing the commissioner of natural resources to remove or require removal of certain structures from such streams and rivers which are capable of transporting boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade either for the whole or part of the year in accordance with the procedures and within the timetable set forth in this article.

          <content>
            <p>§ 52-1-34. Order for removal of structures; service and posting of order
Whenever the commissioner determines that any structure as defined in this article exists, the commissioner may issue an order directed "TO ALL PERSONS IN POSSESSION OR CLAIMING OWNERSHIP OF THIS STRUCTURE." The order shall describe the structure in reasonable detail, shall set forth the unlawful nature of the structure, and shall order that the structure be removed within a reasonable time after the order becomes final to be prescribed in such order. Any order issued by the commissioner under this article shall be signed by the commissioner.  Any such order shall become final unless any person in possession of the structure or any person claiming ownership of or an interest in the structure requests in writing a hearing pursuant to Code Section 52-1-35. The order shall apprise the person or persons of their right to request a hearing and of the procedures necessary to obtain a hearing pursuant to Code Section 52-1-35.  The order, in all cases, shall be served by initially publishing the same once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper printed and published in the county in which the structure is located or in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the structure is located.  The order shall then be served by a peace officer upon any person of suitable age and discretion found in possession of the structure or if no person is found in possession of the structure, the peace officer shall securely post the order in a conspicuous place on the structure.  Any order so posted must be protected from the weather by encasing same in a weatherproof, transparent material.  The date of service shall be stated within the order. The return of the service signed by the peace officer and filed in the office of the commissioner, stating that a copy of such order was served upon a person of suitable age and discretion in possession of the structure personally or that no such person was found in possession of the structure and that a copy of the order was posted in a conspicuous place on the structure in accordance with this Code section, shall be sufficient evidence as to the service of such person in possession; provided, however, that where the address of the person or persons claiming ownership of the structure is known, a copy of such order shall be mailed to such persons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery as part of the service process during the period of time that the order is being published in the newspaper.

Whenever any order issued by the commissioner pursuant to Code Section 52-1-34 becomes final or whenever any order adverse to the owner or possessor of a structure issued by the administrative law judge pursuant to Code Section 52-1-35 becomes final by being unappealed or affirmed upon appeal, the structure shall be deemed contraband.  Upon the structure's becoming contraband, the commissioner or his duly authorized agents shall seize and remove said structure and may sell or dispose of such structure in such manner as the commissioner may direct; provided, however, that prior to such seizure the commissioner shall securely post a notice in a conspicuous place on the structure and, if the address of any person or persons claiming ownership of or any person or persons in possession of the structure is known, the commissioner shall mail a copy of such notice to such person or persons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery informing such person or persons claiming ownership of or in possession of the structure that such structure is considered contraband as a matter of law and that unless the structure is removed within 30 days of the date of the notice, the commissioner, through his duly appointed agents, shall seize and remove said structure and may sell or dispose of such structure in such manner as the commissioner may direct.  Any such notice so posted must be protected from the weather by encasing same in a weatherproof, transparent material.  In the event the commissioner sells the structure or the materials of such structure, he may credit and retain the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal and disposal of the structure and any remaining balance shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the general fund.

Any buildings or facilities acquired by the authority under this chapter which are to be utilized in the manufacturing, processing, assembling, storing, or handling of any agricultural or manufactured produce or products or produce and products of mining or industry, which may be acquired by the authority for operation by a corporation, entity, or persons other than the authority, as distinguished from facilities acquired by the authority for operation by it as a port and allied facilities for the direct use of the public, shall be acquired and financed under this chapter only if, prior to the issuance of bonds therefor, the authority shall have entered into a lease or leases thereof or an agreement or agreements for the sale thereof pursuant to the terms of which the lessees or purchasers shall pay to the authority such rentals or installment purchase payments, or both, as upon the basis of determinations and findings to be made by the authority will be fully sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the bonds issued by the financing thereof, to build up and maintain any reserves deemed by the authority to be advisable in connection therewith, and to pay the cost of maintaining the buildings and facilities in good repair and of keeping them properly insured, unless the leases or agreements obligate the lessees or purchasers to pay for such insurance or maintenance. The authority is given full power and discretion to enter into any such agreements or leases as may in its judgment be desirable for the best interests of the authority. Any such agreement or lease may provide that any surplus capacity of the buildings or facilities which are the subject matter thereof may be utilized by and for the benefit of the general public, in which event, such surplus capacity may be maintained or operated, or both, by either the authority or by the lessee or purchaser under the lease or agreement, or in part by each, all as may be provided in the lease or agreement. Any project may include in part one or more buildings or facilities or combinations thereof to be leased or sold as provided in this Code section and in part other facilities described in paragraph (6) of Code Section 52-2-2, the revenues of the whole being allocated and pledged to the financing of the project as a whole; and in such event, the requirements of this Code section applicable to buildings or facilities to be leased or sold shall be applicable only to the part of the project which consists of the buildings or facilities to be so leased or sold.

          <content>
            <p>§ 52-2-25. Revenue bonds -- Securing of bonds by trust indenture
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign revenues and earnings to be received. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to the purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. The indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, the trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project or projects affected by the indenture.

            <p>§ 52-2-26. Revenue bonds -- Remedies of bondholders and trustee
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under this chapter or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this chapter may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights granted under the laws of this state, granted under this chapter, or granted under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this chapter or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues and other charges for the use of the project or projects; but no holder of any such bond shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such bond or the interest thereon or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the state nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state. Any provision of this chapter or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, any such bondholder or trustee shall have the right by appropriate legal or equitable proceedings (including, without being limited to, mandamus) to enforce compliance by the appropriate public officials with Article VII, Section IV of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and permission is given for the institution of any such proceedings to compel the payment of lease obligations.

While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of the bonds nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. This chapter shall be for the benefit of the state, the authority, and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under this chapter, shall constitute a contract with the holders of the bonds.

          <content>
            <p>§ 52-5-8. Manner of payment for stock; auction sale of stock upon default by subscriber; giving delinquent subscriber notice of auction sale
The directors may require the subscribers to the capital stock to pay the amounts variously subscribed by them in such installments as they may deem proper. The directors may receive cash or property, real or personal, at the agreed value thereof in the payment of such installments. If any subscriber shall neglect to pay any installments as required by resolution of the board of directors, the directors may direct an action to be brought against him forthwith for the amount of the call. Alternatively, after 30 days' notice to the stockholder, the board of directors may, in its discretion, cause his stock to be sold at auction to the highest bidder for cash. Any deficiency in the sum thus realized necessary to make the amount of the call shall be made good by the delinquent. Any surplus over the amount of the call and the expenses of the sale shall be paid over to him. A certificate of stock shall be issued to the purchaser and he shall stand in the same relation to the company as the delinquent would have, had he not so made default. Such sale shall be in the city or other place where the principal office of the company is located, at such time and place as the directors may prescribe. If for any reason it is not practicable to serve the delinquent stockholder with notice of the sale, personally or by mail, or if he is a nonresident of this state, then notice may be given him of the sale by publication in the newspaper in which sheriff's advertisements are published in the county of its principal office, once a week for four weeks prior to the date of the sale.

          <content>
            <p>§ 52-6-42. Appeal to superior court -- Generally
In any case where a pilot is suspended or the pilot's license is revoked or where a fine exceeding $150.00 is imposed by the commissioners on a pilot or any other person, the pilot or other person concerned may petition the judge of the superior court of the county where the judgment or sentence of the commissioners was made, setting forth on oath the circumstances of the case. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the chairperson or secretary of the commissioners at least three days before the petition is presented and the commissioners shall be entitled to be heard as to whether there is sufficient ground for the allowance of an appeal. If the judge of the superior court should think there is sufficient ground for the allowance of an appeal, such judge shall issue an order directing an issue to be made between the appellant and the commissioners, which issue shall be tried by a jury at the next term of the superior court, unless good cause is shown for a continuance. If, at the trial, a verdict should be rendered in favor of the appellant, the judge of the superior court shall order that the fine be remitted, that the suspension be canceled, or that the license be restored. Either the appellant or the commissioners may move the court for a new trial and may appeal to the Court of Appeals from the court's order entered upon the motion, as is provided by law in cases of appeal from orders granting or refusing a new trial in common-law cases.

A pilot bringing a vessel into port or a pilot who has tendered his or her services outside the bar to a vessel which is required under this chapter to accept the services of a pilot shall be entitled to the payment of fees for inward, outward, and all other movements of the vessel within the waters of the port, subject to the commissioners' regulations, before the vessel leaves the port and may require the vessel to give adequate security therefor, to be approved by the commissioners, before the vessel leaves the port. If the payment is not made or the security is not given, no pilot shall be required to take the vessel out. The master, owner, or agent of any vessel which is in readiness to leave must, if possible, give notice of that fact to the commissioners at the port in question or to its authorized representative. The acceptance of security for pilotage fees shall in no way affect the lien specified in Code Section 52-6-49, given in case the fees are not paid.

(A)  The numbering of vessels of such class will not materially aid in their identification;

(B)  An agency of the federal government has a numbering system applicable to the class of vessel to which the vessel in question belongs; and

(C)  The vessel would also be exempt from numbering if it were subject to the federal law;

The board may adopt and may from time to time amend regulations concerning the safety of vessels and persons thereon, either observers or participants, and the protection of the water and adjoining upland resources of this state. Whenever a regatta, boat race, marine parade, tournament, or exhibition is proposed to be held, the person in charge thereof shall, at least 30 days prior thereto, file an application with the department for permission to hold such regatta, race, parade, tournament, or exhibition. The application shall set forth the date, time, and location proposed for holding such regatta, race, parade, tournament, or exhibition and such other information as the department may require. It shall be unlawful to conduct such regatta, race, parade, tournament, or exhibition without authorization of the department.</p>

The Board of Natural Resources is authorized to adopt any regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of this article, including, but not limited to, regulations setting forth the criteria for determining when an indemnity bond shall be required under Code Section 52-7-19 and the appropriate amount of the bond and when a forfeiture bond shall be required under Code Section 52-7-19, the appropriate amount of the bond, and the conditions for default thereunder. In adopting the indemnity bond regulations, the board shall include, without limitation, criteria relating to the expense of restoring the water body and its surrounding area to the state of cleanliness existing before the conduct of an event authorized under Code Section 52-7-19. In adopting the forfeiture bond regulations, the board shall include, without limitation, criteria relating to the magnitude of the event, the water body and surrounding area upon which it will be held, and the potential public safety hazard inherent in the event. The board may, by regulation, establish bond forfeiture conditions for categories of noncompliance, including, but not limited to, failure or refusal to comply with requirements to provide facilities for the convenience of participants and spectators, requirements relating to public safety, and requirements relating to damage to the water body and surrounding area upon which the event was held.

The person asserting such lien may move to foreclose by making an affidavit to a court of competent jurisdiction showing all facts necessary to constitute such lien and the amount claimed to be due. Such affidavit shall aver that the notice requirements of Code Section 52-7-71 have been complied with, and such affidavit shall also aver that a demand for payment has been made and refused or that the identity of the owner cannot be ascertained. The person foreclosing shall verify the statement by oath or affirmation and shall affix his signature thereto.

            <p>§ 52-8-3. Recovery of forfeiture; attachment and replevy of vessels
Upon receipt by the Board of Pilotage Commissioners of satisfactory evidence of the offense specified in Code Section 52-8-1, it shall be the duty of the board to proceed to recover the forfeiture provided for in that Code section by process of attachment in the name of the state, which may be issued as other attachments on the oath of the informer or of one of the commissioners and may be levied on the vessel from which the offense was committed. The vessel may be replevied by the master, owner, or consignee by giving bond, payable to the state, in double the amount of the penalty, with the condition to have the vessel forthcoming to satisfy such judgment as may be rendered in the action.

            <p>§ 52-9-1. Projects for improving navigation channels
The General Assembly recognizes the need for maintaining navigation inlets, harbors, and rivers to promote commercial and recreational uses of our coastal waters and their resources. The General Assembly further recognizes that dredging activities to deepen or maintain navigation channels within tidal inlets, as well as the entrances to harbors and rivers, often alter the natural drift of sand resources within the littoral zone. This alteration can be exacerbated when the sand resources are deposited in designated upland or offshore disposal areas instead of being returned to the natural river-sand transport-beach system. This alteration can adversely impact natural resources, recreation, tourism, and associated coastal economies. Moreover, the General Assembly believes in the duties of government to protect life and property. Therefore, it is the policy of this state that there shall be no net loss of sand from the state's coastal barrier beaches resulting from dredging activities to deepen or maintain navigation channels within tidal inlets, as well as the entrances to harbors and rivers.
