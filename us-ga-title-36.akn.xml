The rate so fixed shall be plainly written or printed upon the face of the order. However, interest shall not be paid on such warrant or warrants after July 1 following the year in which they were presented unless the warrant or warrants are again presented and payment is refused for want of funds.

            <p>§ 36-14-2. Building and maintaining bridges over rivers bordering adjacent states
Counties lying adjacent to any river on the border or forming the boundary between this state and another shall have the same power, acting by and through the proper county authorities, to build and maintain bridges over such river as the counties now have to build and maintain bridges over streams lying wholly within their borders, provided that this power shall not be exercised except to cooperate with the proper authorities of the adjacent state in building and maintaining such bridges, on the principle that each state is to build simultaneously from its own bank to the middle of the river and afterwards to maintain and keep up the part of the bridge which it has built; and provided, further, that no bridge shall be erected under this Code section at any point where the river exceeds, at low-water mark, 2,000 feet in breadth.

The amount of such additional costs to be charged and collected, if any, in each such case shall be fixed by the chief judge of the superior court of the circuit in which such county is located. Such additional costs shall not be charged and collected unless the chief judge first determines that a need exists for a law library in the county. The clerk of each and every such court in such counties in which such a law library is established shall collect such fees and remit the same to the treasurer of the board of trustees of the county law library of the county in which the case was brought, on the first day of each month. Where fees collected by the treasurer have been allocated for the purpose of establishing or maintaining the codification of county ordinances, the allocated amount shall in turn be remitted by the treasurer to the county governing authority for said purpose on a monthly basis or as otherwise agreed by the treasurer and the county governing authority.

          <content>
            <p>§ 36-2-3. Appointment of commissioners to change districts; employment and compensation of surveyor; approval of commissioners' report by judge of probate court
Whenever it is necessary and expedient to lay out a new militia district, to change the lines of old districts, or to consolidate or abolish old districts, the judge of the probate court may, at any time, appoint three commissioners who are citizens of the district or districts from which it is proposed to make the new district or to change the lines thereof, whose duty it shall be to lay out and define the lines and to report the same to the judge of the probate court. The commissioners shall have authority to engage the services of a competent surveyor to assist them in their duties. The surveyor shall be paid for his services, out of the county treasury, the same compensation county surveyors are paid for similar services rendered to a citizen. If the judge of the probate court approves the report of the commissioners, he shall have all proceedings in the matter entered on his minutes, after which the district laid out or the line changed or defined shall be known and regarded accordingly.

            <p>§ 36-21-1. Legislative intent
It is declared to be the intent of the General Assembly that a method be provided whereby counties and certain other entities of this state may, in the discretion of their respective governing bodies, provide group health and other employee benefits to their employees through a common administrative and investment system. Such a system based on joint participation will permit counties and other entities, regardless of size, to provide certain benefits to their employees, will reduce overall administrative costs which might be prohibitive if undertaken individually, and will make possible better investment opportunities. It is intended that this chapter be liberally construed to effectuate this intent.

            <p>§ 36-30-2. Management and disposition of property
The council or other governing body of a municipal corporation has discretion in the management and disposition of its property. Where such discretion is exercised in good faith, equity will not interfere therewith.

            <p>§ 36-31-5. Certificate of existence of minimum standards; manner of determination; disposition and evidentiary effect of certificate
Every local law granting an original municipal charter shall have attached thereto a certificate by the author of the bill stating that the minimum standards required by this chapter exist as to the area embraced. Existence of the standards may be determined, as to population, by estimate based on the number of dwellings in the area multiplied by the average family size in the area, as determined by the last preceding federal census or by other reliable evidence acceptable to the author. As to development of the area, existence of the standards may be determined by estimate based on actual survey, county maps or records, aerial photographs, or some other reliable map acceptable to the author. The certificate shall be a permanent part of the charter and shall constitute conclusive evidence of the existence of the standards required by this chapter.

            <p>§ 36-31-7. Power to license and regulate alcoholic beverages
When a new municipal corporation is created by local Act, the governing authority of the municipal corporation shall have all the same powers to license and regulate alcoholic beverages within its territory as did the governing authority of the county when such territory was within the unincorporated area of the county. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is specifically provided that no petition, election, or other condition precedent which might otherwise be required under Title 3 to authorize sales of any alcoholic beverages shall be required in order for the governing authority of the municipality to exercise such powers.

Notice of intention to make such sale, lease, or other disposition of a municipal waterworks or electric or gas plant, setting out the price and other general terms and conditions of the proposed sale, lease, or disposition, shall be given by publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in some newspaper published in the municipality and, if no newspaper is published in the municipality, then in some newspaper published in the county in which the municipality is located and, if there is no such newspaper, then in some newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality. After ten days from the last publication of such notice, the plant may be disposed of unless, within ten days after the last publication of the notice, a petition signed by not less than 20 percent of the qualified voters of the municipality is filed, objecting to and protesting against the sale, lease, or disposition. If the petition, so signed, is filed, the sale shall not be made unless submitted to a special election ordered for the purpose of determining whether a majority, which shall constitute two-thirds of those voting at the election, favors the sale, lease, or other disposition. Such election shall be ordered by the municipality to be held not less than 50 days after the date of the filing of the objecting petition with the municipality. The election shall be held in accordance with and in all respects be governed by the Acts of the General Assembly in regard to elections to determine whether municipalities shall issue bonds or not.

          <content>
            <p>§ 36-39-6. Paving by railroad having tracks in street
Any railroad or street railway having tracks located in a street at the time of a proposed improvement shall be required by the governing body to pave the width of its tracks and two feet on each side thereof. Such paving shall be done with the same material and in the same manner as the rest of the street to be paved, provided that the governing body may require such paving to be of a different material and manner of construction when, in its judgment, this is rendered necessary by the uses of the street by the railway. The work shall be performed under the supervision and subject to the approval of the city's municipal corporation's engineer. If the railway, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the notice to do such work, does not agree in writing to comply with such order or if the work is not completed to the satisfaction of the municipal corporation's engineer within such time as may be prescribed by the governing body, the governing body may have the work done and may charge the cost and expense thereof to the railway company. The governing body shall have a lien against the railway company for such cost and expense. Such lien shall have the same rank and priority and shall be enforced in the same manner as the liens provided for in Code Section 36-39-20.

            <p>§ 36-39-8. Resolution letting contract for improvements following time for protests or filing of petition
After the expiration of the time for objection or protest on the part of the property owners, if no sufficient protest is filed, or on receipt of a petition for an improvement signed by the owners of a majority of the frontage of the land to be assessed, if the petition is found to be in proper form and properly executed, the governing body shall adopt a resolution reciting that no protest has been filed or that a petition was filed, as the case may be, and expressing the determination of the governing body to proceed with the improvement. The resolution shall state the kind of improvement, define the extent and character of the same, and specify such other matters as may be necessary to instruct the engineer employed by the municipal corporation in the performance of his or her duties in preparing for such improvement the necessary plans, plats, profiles, specifications, and estimates. The resolution shall set forth any and all such reasonable terms and conditions as the governing body deems proper to impose with reference to the letting of the contract and the provisions thereof. The governing body, by such resolution, shall provide that the contractor shall execute to the municipal corporation a good and sufficient bond, as provided in Part 3 of Article 3 of Chapter 91 of this title, and may also require a bond in an amount to be stated in the resolution for the maintenance of the good condition of the improvements for a period of not less than five years from the time of completion, in the discretion of the governing body. The resolution shall also direct the clerk of the municipal corporation to advertise for sealed proposals for furnishing the materials and performing the work necessary in making such improvements.

            <p>§ 36-39-9. Work performed by municipal corporation; property owners' objections to performance of work by municipal corporation
As an alternative to contracting for the improvement, the governing body shall have the right, at its option and in its discretion, to provide that the work necessary in making the improvement shall be done by the municipal corporation itself. In such event, the municipal corporation shall procure all materials, provide the machinery and equipment, and do all of the work necessary in making such improvement. If the governing body determines that the municipal corporation shall itself do the work necessary in making the improvement, the resolution expressing the determination of the governing body to proceed with the improvement shall so state; and such resolution shall fix a time and place at which the owners of the property affected by the proposed improvement shall have the right to file objections thereto. Notice of the resolution and of the intention of the governing body to cause the work to be done by the municipal corporation shall be published in at least six consecutive issues of a daily paper having a general circulation in the municipal corporation or once a week for two weeks in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements for the county in which the municipal corporation is situated are published. The notice shall set out the time and place at which objections may be filed, which time shall be not less than ten days following the last publication of the notice. The owners of the lots or parcels of land fronting or abutting upon any street or portion thereof upon which such improvement is proposed to be made shall have the right, within the time prescribed, to file written objections to the performance of the work by the municipal corporation. In the event that the owners of a majority of the lineal frontage of the lots or parcels of land fronting or abutting upon any such street or portion thereof object to the doing of the work by the municipal corporation, the work shall be done under contract and the governing body shall proceed in the manner provided in this chapter for the letting of the work under contract. If no objections are filed by the owners of a majority of the lineal frontage of the lots or parcels of land fronting or abutting on any such street or portion thereof within the time prescribed, the municipal corporation itself shall proceed with the doing of the work necessary in making the improvement. Where the work of making the improvement is done by the municipal corporation, the cost thereof shall include the entire cost of all materials used and labor done in the performance of the work, shall include a reasonable rental for the use of machinery, equipment, and materials used in the doing of the work, and shall also include all engineering, legal, and other expenses incurred in connection with the doing of the work or the proceedings under which the same is done. When the work of making the improvement is done by the municipal corporation, the provisions of Code Section 36-39-8 relating to the letting of a contract and the provisions of Code Sections 36-39-10 and 36-39-11 shall not apply.

The treasurer shall turn over the same to the marshal or chief of police of the municipal corporation or his deputy, who shall levy the same upon the abutting real estate liable for the assessment and previously assessed for the improvements. After advertisement and other proceedings as in case of sales for city taxes, the real estate shall be sold at public outcry to the highest bidder. Such sales shall vest an absolute title in the purchaser, subject to the lien of the remaining unpaid installments with interest and also subject to the right of redemption as provided in Article 3 of Chapter 4 of Title 48.

The defendant shall have the right to file an affidavit denying that the whole or any part of the amount for which the execution issued is due and stating what amount he admits to be due, which amount so admitted to be due shall be paid and collected before the affidavit is received and the affidavit shall be received for the balance.

            <p>§ 36-39-25. Issuance of bonds; payment; interest; terms; form
The governing body, after the expiration of 30 days from the passage of the ordinance confirming and levying the assessment, shall, by resolution, provide for the issuance of bonds in the aggregate amount of the assessments remaining unpaid, bearing date not more than 30 days after the passage of the ordinance fixing the assessment and of such denomination as the governing body shall determine. Such bond or bonds, unless authority is thereafter granted and exercised for making them direct obligations of the municipal corporation, shall in no event become a liability of the municipal corporation or of the governing body of the municipal corporation issuing them. The bonds shall be payable in equal annual installments over the same period of years, not less than two nor more than ten, as has been fixed and provided by the governing body of the municipal corporation for the payment of the assessments in installments under Code Section 36-39-16. One installment of any such series of bonds, with interest upon the whole series to date, shall be payable on such day and at such place as may be determined by the governing body, and one installment thereof with the yearly interest upon the whole amount remaining unpaid shall be payable on the same day in each succeeding year, until all are paid. Such bonds shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding 10 percent per annum from their date until maturity, payable annually. They shall be designated as "street-improvement bonds" and on the face thereof shall recite the street or streets, the part of the street or streets, or other public places for the improvement of which they have been issued. Unless authority is thereafter granted and exercised for making them direct obligations of the municipal corporation, such bonds shall be payable solely from assessments which have been fixed upon the lots or tracts of land benefited by the improvement under authority of this chapter. The bonds shall be signed by the mayor or chairman of the board of commissioners and attested by the clerk of the governing body, shall have the impression of the corporate seal of the municipal corporation thereon, and shall have interest coupons attached. All bonds issued by authority of this chapter shall be payable at such place either within or outside this state as shall be designated by the governing body.

            <p>§ 36-39-28. Petition for validation of ordinance establishing assessments; time; contents
At any time within 60 days after the assessments are finally determined and fixed, the municipal corporation may file a petition in the superior court of the county in which the municipal corporation is situated, along with a copy of the ordinance, in which petition shall be alleged the fact of the passage and approval of the ordinance, the street or part of a street affected thereby, the character of paving or other improvement intended, and the approximate estimate of the cost. The petition shall allege that the ordinance is authorized by law and that it will create a lien on all real property abutting on such street or part of a street for the payment by the owner of each lot or parcel of land so abutting of the pro rata share of expense assessed to each lot or parcel of land, as well as on any street or other railroad therein, if any such there are, and shall pray for a judgment by the court declaring the ordinance valid, legal, and binding and that the liens be set up as alleged. It shall not be necessary in such petition to allege the names of the owners of the abutting property or railroads to be affected, but it shall be sufficient to describe the street or portion thereof to be improved and to indicate that the property on the street is to be charged with the expense.

          <content>
            <p>§ 36-41-2. Legislative findings and declaration of public necessityIt is found, determined, and declared:
(1)  That there exists within the large municipalities of the state a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing which a significant portion of the persons and families residing or desiring to reside in such municipalities can afford. This shortage is inimical to the safety, health, and welfare of the residents of this state and the sound growth of its large municipalities. The cost of financing the ownership and rehabilitation of housing in such municipalities is a major factor affecting the ability of a person to obtain decent and safe housing therein. In order to remedy such housing shortages, it is necessary to implement a public program to reduce the cost of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of housing, in order to make the acquisition of housing feasible for all persons and families residing or desiring to reside in the large municipalities of the state;

(2)  That it is necessary and essential that public corporations be created for such large municipalities of the state directly, or indirectly through qualified lending institutions, to make loans at rates below market to finance either the acquisition or rehabilitation or both of residential housing and to acquire mortgages in order to encourage investment in and upgrade urban areas;(3)  That it is necessary and in the best interests of the state to provide loans at rates below market for the acquisition and rehabilitation of housing which will:
(A)  Provide for and promote the public health, safety, and welfare in the large municipalities of the state;

(B)  Reduce unemployment and encourage the increase of industrial and commercial activities and economic development in the large municipalities;

(C)  Provide for the efficient and well-planned growth and development of the large municipalities, including the elimination and prevention of slum areas and blight, and for the proper coordination of industrial facilities with public services, mass transportation facilities, and residential development, by providing an incentive for home ownership within the geographical limits of the large municipalities;

(D)  Assist persons and families in acquiring and owning decent, safe, and sanitary housing which they can afford within the geographic limits of the large municipalities;

(E)  Promote the integration of families of varying economic means in the large municipalities; and

(F)  Preserve and increase the tax base of the large municipalities; and

(4)  Accordingly, that it is a valid public purpose, as a matter of public health, safety, convenience, and welfare, to assist in providing financing for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of housing in the large municipalities of the state and that the creation of public corporations and instrumentalities of the state is the most feasible method by which the state can accomplish such public purposes.

            <p>§ 36-41-4. Creation of authority; governing board; filing of resolutions with Secretary of State; filling of vacancies on board; officers; compensation of members of board; promulgation of rules and regulations
There is created in and for each municipality of this state, as defined in paragraph (11) of Code Section 36-41-3, a public body corporate, which shall be deemed to be an instrumentality of the state, to be known as the "urban residential finance authority" of such municipality and which shall be governed by a board of not less than seven nor more than nine members. Each member of the board shall be a resident of the large municipality activating the authority. No more than two members of the board may be appointed by the mayor of the large municipality activating the authority with the remaining members appointed by the governing body of the municipality for such term and upon such conditions as specified by resolution of the governing body. Any member of the governing body of the large municipality, the mayor or other chief executive thereof, and the chief fiscal officer thereof may serve on the board. The provisions of Chapter 62A of this title relating to ethics and conflicts of interest shall apply to members of the board of each authority created under this Code section. No authority created under this Code section shall transact any business or exercise any powers under this chapter until the governing body of the large municipality activating the authority, by resolution, declares that there is need for an authority to function in such municipality. A copy of the resolution adopted by the governing body and copies of any resolution adopted by the governing body providing for filling vacancies in the membership of the board of the authority or making any changes in the membership of the board of the authority shall be filed with the Secretary of State. Appointments to fill vacancies on the board of any authority, either for an unexpired or full term as fixed in the original resolution creating the same, shall be made by the governing body of the municipality. The members of the board of each authority shall elect one of their members as chairman and another as vice-chairman and shall also elect a secretary-treasurer, who need not be a member of the board and need not be a resident of the municipality activating such authority. Each member of the board of each authority shall receive the same expense allowance per day as that received by a member of the General Assembly for each day such member is in attendance at a meeting of the authority, but shall receive the same for not more than 20 meeting days during any one fiscal year. For attendance at any conference in connection with the performance of their official duties, other than a meeting of the authority, members shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred and travel expenses in the same manner as provided by law for members of the General Assembly but shall receive the same for not more than ten days during any one fiscal year. However, if the secretary-treasurer is not a member of the board, then the secretary-treasurer may receive such compensation for his services as may be agreed upon by the members of the board. Each authority shall make rules and regulations for its government and may delegate to one or more of its members or its officers, agents, and employees such powers and duties as may be deemed necessary and proper.

The authority may issue such bond anticipation notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated. Such notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. As with its bonds, the authority may sell such notes at public sale or at private sale.

Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of such notes, but it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated. Bond anticipation notes shall not be issued in an amount exceeding the par value of the bonds in anticipation of which they are to be issued.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to authority granted the General Assembly by the Constitution of Georgia. Each authority created pursuant to this chapter is created for nonprofit and public purposes; and it is found, determined, and declared that the creation of each such authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that each authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this chapter; and for such reasons the state covenants with the holders from time to time of the bonds, notes, and other obligations issued under this chapter that no such authority shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments imposed by this state or any counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts thereof upon any property acquired by the authority or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or leased by it to others or upon its activities in the operation or maintenance of any such property or on any income derived by the authority in the form of fees, recording fees, rentals, charges, purchase price, installments, or otherwise; and that the bonds, notes, and other obligations of each such authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within this state. The tax exemption provided for in this Code section shall not include any exemption from sales and use tax on property purchased by the authority or for use by the authority.

            <p>§ 36-44-2. Legislative findings and purpose
It is found and declared that economically and socially depressed areas exist within counties and municipalities of this state and that these areas contribute to or cause unemployment, limit the tax resources of counties and municipalities, and create a greater demand for governmental services and, in general, have a deleterious effect upon the public health, safety, morals, and welfare. It is, therefore, in the public interest that such areas be redeveloped to the maximum extent practicable to improve economic and social conditions therein in order to abate or eliminate such deleterious effects. To encourage such redevelopment, it is essential that the counties and municipalities of this state have additional powers to form a more effective partnership with private enterprise to overcome economic limitations that have previously impeded or prohibited redevelopment of such areas. It is the purpose of this chapter, therefore, to grant such additional powers to the counties and municipalities of this state, and it is the intention of the General Assembly that this chapter be liberally construed to carry out such purpose.

Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of such notes, but it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated. Bond anticipation notes shall not be issued in an amount exceeding the par value of the bonds in anticipation of which they are to be issued.

            <p>§ 36-44-15. Determining tax millage rate; no freeze to ad valorem tax millage
For the purpose of fixing the tax millage rate to fund the annual budget of each political subdivision or county or independent board of education having the power to levy taxes or set ad valorem tax millage rates on property located within a tax allocation district, which has consented to the inclusion of its ad valorem property taxes for the computation of tax allocation increments as provided in Code Section 36-44-9, the taxable value of property subject to ad valorem property taxes within a tax allocation district shall not exceed the tax allocation increment base of the district until the district is terminated. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to freeze the ad valorem tax millage rate of any political subdivision or county or independent board of education consenting to the inclusion of its ad valorem property taxes as a basis for computing tax allocation increments, and any such rate may be increased or decreased at any time after the creation of a tax allocation district in the same manner and under the same authority that such rate has been previously fixed by such political subdivision or county or independent board of education.

As an additional source for financing redevelopment costs, a political subdivision or its redevelopment agency may borrow funds from financial institutions and, in connection therewith, may pledge or assign lease contracts or revenue received from lease contracts on property owned by the political subdivision or its redevelopment agency within a redevelopment area. A political subdivision or its redevelopment agency is authorized to enter into contracts with financial institutions for the purpose of exercising the authority provided by this Code section, and such contracts may obligate the political subdivision or its redevelopment agency for any number of years not exceeding 25. Contractual obligations incurred by a political subdivision pursuant to this Code section shall not constitute debt within the meaning of Article IX, Section V of the Constitution.

The failure or refusal of any county treasurer to render the account and make the showing provided for by Code Section 36-6-22, after being notified to do so by the county governing authority, shall constitute malpractice in office. A conviction therefor shall subject the offender to removal from office. During the continuance of such failure or refusal after the notice aforesaid, the county governing authority shall suspend the treasurer from duty and shall appoint some fit and proper person to take charge of the county funds and perform the duties of his office until the question of his removal can be passed upon and decided by the proper tribunal. Proper bonds shall be taken from the person so appointed, as provided by law. The power given by this Code section and Code Section 36-6-22 to inquire into the affairs of the treasurer of the county and to suspend him from office in certain cases shall in no way affect the liability of the treasurer or that of the sureties on his bond.

            <p>§ 36-60-15.1. Operation and maintenance of water treatment systems by private entities
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any county or municipal corporation of this state is authorized, in the discretion of its governing authority, to enter into valid and binding leases and contracts with private persons, firms, associations, or corporations for any period of time not to exceed 20 years to provide for the operation and maintenance of all or a portion of its waste-water treatment system, storm-water system, water system, or sewer system, or any combination of such systems, which leases and contracts may include provisions for the design, construction, repair, reconditioning, replacement, maintenance, and operation of the system, or any combination of such services and functions. If a contract or lease to be awarded pursuant to this Code section includes provisions for the construction of public works, the laws relating to the procurement of such contracts shall also apply; provided, however, that any bonding requirements shall apply only to the construction provisions of the contract or lease. Prior to entering into a lease or contract pursuant to this Code section, the governing authority shall solicit competitive sealed proposals. The governing authority shall first establish criteria for evaluation of any applicants submitting proposals on such leases or contracts for the purpose of assisting the governing authority in making a review of such applicants' previous performance on projects of comparable magnitude, the environmental compliance record of such applicants, and any relevant civil or criminal penalties incurred by such applicants during the five years immediately preceding the execution of the lease or contract. The governing authority shall take into consideration such information to assist it in determining the eligibility of any applicant. The award of a lease or contract pursuant to this Code section shall be made to the responsible and responsive applicant whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the governmental entity, taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. All information required by the county or municipality pursuant to this Code section shall be provided by the applicant under oath. For purposes of this Code section, "applicant" means any individual, firm, association, or corporation submitting a proposal on such leases or contracts.

              <p>The General Assembly finds that allowing local government to license, contract with, or both license and contract with private companies to finance, construct, maintain, improve, own, or operate, or any combination thereof, private toll roads and bridges can provide significant public benefits to the citizens of this state in facilitating transportation of the general public without the need for additional public tax revenues. The General Assembly also finds that such facilitation of transportation of the public by private enterprise is an important public purpose and function. The General Assembly further finds that general law impediments to such arrangements should be removed. To implement these findings, this Code section shall control the subject matter thereof notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary.</p>

              <p>Each county and municipal corporation may require the owner or operator of a taxicab to obtain a certificate of public necessity and convenience or medallion in order to operate such taxicab within the unincorporated areas of the county or within the corporate limits of the municipal corporation, respectively, and may exercise its authority under Code Section 48-13-9 to require such owners or operators to pay a regulatory fee to the county or municipal corporation. The General Assembly finds and declares that any county or municipality exercising the powers granted in this Code section is legitimately concerned with the qualifications and records of drivers of taxicabs; with the location, accessibility, and insured state of companies operating taxicabs; and with the safety and comfort of taxicabs. Without limitation, each such county or municipality may exercise the powers granted in this Code section by ordinance to the same extent as the ordinances reviewed by the Georgia Court of Appeals in the case of Hadley v. City of Atlanta, 232 Ga. App. 871, 875</p>

Such urban redevelopment agency may designate a public nonprofit, private corporation, body, or entity to perform this function and to otherwise perform the activities contemplated in this Code section.
(B)  A sponsoring local government or an urban redevelopment agency shall be authorized to issue, individually or in sequenced stages, written requests for expressions of interest, qualifications, or proposals, or any combination thereof, or other similar methods of procurement or solicitation. Such requests shall indicate the scope of the project, the proposed public and private financial participation in the project, including, but not limited to, the rights, responsibilities, obligations, revenue sharing features, any lease, license, availability or other payment rights, and any other allocations of interests and federal and state income tax benefits in respect of real and personal property relating to a project. Such requests shall include the factors to be used in evaluating responses, the relative importance of any applicable evaluation factors, and other contractual terms and conditions expected, including any unique capabilities or qualifications that will be required of respondents, as determined in the sole discretion of the designated representative of the sponsoring local government. Public notice of such requests shall be made at least 30 days prior to the date set for the release of said request by posting a legal notice on the websites and weekly in the legal organ of the sponsoring local government and the public body implementing the project, in substantially the same manner utilized by such public bodies in order t</p>

              <p>The public body implementing the project and the sponsoring local government, with the participation of any designated representatives of other participating public bodies as determined by the sponsoring local government, may engage in individual discussions and interviews with each respondent deemed fully qualified, responsible, and suitable on the basis of initial responses and with emphasis on professional competence and ability to meet the level of private financial participation as called for in such request. Repetitive interviews may be conducted. Any such interviews shall be deemed to be a part of the procurement process.(ii) 
(I)  At the conclusion of the final stage, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request and all information developed in the selection process, the public body implementing the surface transportation project, in an open and public meeting subject to the provisions of Chapter 14 of Title 50, shall rank the proposals in accordance with the factors set forth in the request for proposal or invitation for bids.

(II)  After ranking the proposals, the public body implementing the project shall begin negotiations with the first ranked private entity. If such public body and first ranked private entity do not reach a comprehensive agreement or interim agreement, such public body may conduct negotiations with the next ranked private entity. Such process shall continue until such public body either voluntarily abandons the process or executes a comprehensive agreement or interim agreement with a private entity. Negotiations conducted with one or more selected respondents pursuant to this Code section shall continue to be deemed an active procurement until the execution of the final, definitive agreement with the selected respondent or respondents.

(D)  A dispute over the award of a contract under this chapter shall be resolved by the filing of a petition in the superior court of the county in which the sponsoring local government is located within 30 days of the awarding of such contract and shall be determined through the use of a special master appointed by the judge of the superior court of the county in which the sponsoring local government is located. The special master shall not be authorized to enjoin or otherwise delay or suspend the execution of the contract and any work to be performed under such contract. The decision of the special master with regard to such dispute shall be appealable for a de novo review to the superior court of the county in which the sponsoring local government is located within 30 days following the decision of the special master.

            <p>§ 36-61-6. Formulation of workable program
For the purposes of this chapter, a municipality or county may formulate a workable program for utilizing appropriate private and public resources, including those specified in Code Section 36-61-11, to eliminate and prevent the development or spread of pockets of blight, to encourage needed urban rehabilitation, to provide for the redevelopment of pockets of blight, or to undertake such of the aforesaid activities or such other feasible municipal or county activities as may be suitably employed to achieve the objectives of such workable program. Such workable program may include, without limitation, provision for the prevention of the spread of pockets of blight into areas of the municipality or county which are free from pockets of blight, through diligent enforcement of housing, zoning, and occupancy controls and standards; the rehabilitation or conservation of pockets of blight or portions thereof by replanning, removing congestion, providing parks, playgrounds, and other public improvements, including without limitation surface transportation projects, encouraging voluntary rehabilitation, and compelling the repair and rehabilitation of deteriorated or deteriorating structures; and the clearance and redevelopment of pockets of blight or portions thereof.

            <p>§ 36-62-3. Constitutional authority for chapter; finding of public purposes; tax exemption
This chapter is passed pursuant to authority granted the General Assembly by Article IX, Section VI, Paragraph III of the Constitution of this state. Each authority created by this chapter is created for nonprofit and public purposes, and it is found, determined, and declared that the creation of each such authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that the authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this chapter. For such reasons, the state covenants, from time to time, with the holders of the bonds issued under this chapter that such authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments imposed by the state or any of its counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts upon any property acquired by the authority or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or leased by it to others (other than property leased for the purposes of a "project" as defined in subparagraph (J) or (K) of paragraph (6) of Code Section 36-62-2, which shall be taxable by the state and its counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, and taxing districts) or upon its activities in the operation or maintenance of any such property or on any income derived by the authority in the form of fees, recording fees, rentals, charges, purchase price, installments, or otherwise, and that the bonds of such authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within this state. The tax exemption provided in this Code section shall not include any exemption from sales and use tax on property purchased by the authority or for use by the authority.

            <p>§ 36-62-9. Purposes of chapter; issuance of bonds or bond anticipation notes; exceptionsThe purposes of this chapter are to develop and promote trade, commerce, industry, and employment opportunities for the public good and the general welfare and to promote the general welfare of the state. No bonds or bond anticipation notes, except refunding bonds, shall be issued by an authority under this chapter unless its board of directors adopts a resolution finding that the project for which such bonds or notes are to be issued will promote the foregoing objectives and will increase or maintain employment in the territorial area of such authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement:
(1)  Bonds or bond anticipation notes may be issued to finance projects for air and water pollution control facilities and for sewage and solid waste disposal facilities, as provided in this chapter, without a finding that the project will increase or maintain employment, so long as the appropriate certification described in this chapter has been secured from the federal, state, or local agency having jurisdiction in the premises; and(2)  Bonds or bond anticipation notes may also be issued by an authority to finance the acquisition or development of land as the site for an industrial park as provided in this chapter without a finding that the project will increase or maintain employment if its board of directors shall adopt a resolution finding that the tract of land to be included in the project is not intended for use by a single enterprise; will be suitable primarily for use as building sites for a group of enterprises engaged in industrial, distribution, or wholesale businesses; and that either:
(A)  The control and administration of the tract is to be vested in the authority or in another county or joint county and municipal development authority (or in a corporation organized under Chapter 3 of Title 14, the "Georgia Nonprofit Corporation Code") having as one of its purposes the development of trade, commerce, industry, and employment opportunities; or

(B)  The uses of such tract of land are to be regulated by protective restrictions to be approved by the authority and determined by the authority to be appropriate to encourage and facilitate use thereof by business enterprises engaged in industrial, distribution, or wholesale businesses.

              <p>The recovery and utilization of resources contained in sewage sludge and solid waste and the generation of electrical and other forms of energy from water resources promotes trade, commerce, industry, and employment opportunities by creating a new industry to recover and utilize such resources and by creating a climate highly favorable to the location of new industrial facilities in areas where such resources are recovered or available by providing additional sources of energy and a method of processing and disposing of sewage and solid waste in an efficient and environmentally sound manner. It is therefore in the public interest and is vital to the public welfare of the people of the State of Georgia, and it is declared to be the purpose of this chapter, to create resource recovery development authorities to recover and utilize resources contained in sewage sludge, solid waste, and water resources. It is likewise in the public interest and is vital to the public welfare of the people of the State of Georgia, and it is declared to be the intent of this chapter to preserve and do nothing to interfere with the practice of recycling solid waste for use again by industry and the public thereby preserving and reusing important natural and other resources, except as specifically provided for in this chapter.</p>

            <p>§ 36-63-3. Constitutional authority for chapter; finding of public purposes; tax exemption
This chapter is enacted pursuant to authority granted to the General Assembly by the Constitution of Georgia. Each authority created by this chapter is created for nonprofit and public purposes; and it is found, determined, and declared that the creation of each such authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that the authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this chapter. For such reasons, the state covenants from time to time with the holders of the bonds issued under this chapter that such authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments imposed by the state or any of its counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts upon any property acquired by the authority or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or leased by it to others; or upon its activities in the operation or maintenance of any such property or on any income derived by the authority in the form of fees, recording fees, rentals, charges, purchase price, installments, or otherwise; and that the bonds of such authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within the state. The tax exemption provided in this Code section shall not include any exemption from sales and use tax on property purchased by the authority or for use by the authority.

              <p>Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this Code section, the obligations of any authority evidenced by bonds, bond anticipation notes, trust indentures, deeds to secure obligations, security agreements, or mortgages executed in connection therewith may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by the board of directors of the authority. The authority, in such instruments, may provide for the pledging of all or any part of its revenues, income, or charges and for the mortgaging, encumbering, or conveying of all or any part of its real or personal property; may covenant against pledging any or all of its revenues, income, or charges; and may further provide for the disposition of proceeds realized from the sale of any bonds and bond anticipation notes, for the replacement of lost, destroyed, stolen, or mutilated bonds and notes, and for the payment and redemption of such bonds and notes. Similarly, subject to the limitations and procedures of this Code section, undertakings of an authority may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders and noteholders may enforce rights against the authority and provide for rights upon breach of any covenant, condition, or obligation of the authority. Bonds, resolutions, trust indentures, mortgages, or deeds to secure obligations executed by an authority and bond anticipation notes executed by an authority may contain such provisions not otherwise contrary to law as the authority shall deem necessary or desirable.</p>

The authority may issue notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated. The notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. As with its bonds, the authority may sell such notes at public or private sale.

The governing body of any municipality or county may dedicate and set apart for use as parks, playgrounds, and recreation centers and for other recreation purposes any lands or buildings or both, owned or leased by such municipality or county and not dedicated or devoted to another or inconsistent public use. Such municipality or county, in such manner as may now or hereafter be authorized or provided by law for the acquisition of lands or buildings for public purposes by the municipality or county, may acquire or lease lands or buildings or both, within or beyond the corporate limits of the municipality, for parks, playgrounds, recreation centers, and other recreational purposes. When the governing body of the municipality so dedicates, sets apart, acquires, or leases lands or buildings for such purposes, it may, on its own initiative, provide for their conduct, equipment, and maintenance, according to this chapter, by making an appropriation from the general municipal or county funds.

              <p>of the Constitution. It is the purpose of this chapter to grant authority to the General Assembly to provide by local law for a form of governmental reorganization whereby the charter of a municipality is repealed in order for the county in which the municipality is located to succeed to the corporate powers, functions, rights, assets, and liabilities of the municipality. This chapter shall be liberally construed to carry out effectively such purpose.

            <p>§ 36-69-2. "Local emergency" defined
As used in this chapter, the term "local emergency" means the existence of conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the territorial limits of a political subdivision of the state or on a campus of an institution within the University System of Georgia or the Technical College System of Georgia caused by natural disasters, riots, civil disturbances, or other situations presenting major law enforcement and other public safety problems, which conditions are or are likely to be beyond the control of the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of that political subdivision of the state and which require the combined forces of other political subdivisions of the state to combat.

            <p>§ 36-7-11. Issuance of execution for fees
A county surveyor who makes a survey for a person who neglects to pay him may make oath before the judge of the probate court of his county of the performance of such service and its value. The judge of the probate court shall thereupon issue a fi. fa. in his name for the use of the surveyor, against the person defaulting. Such person may defend himself therefor in the same manner as persons against whom executions issue for detaining county funds.

            <p>§ 36-7-14. Appointment of disinterested surveyor; oath
When any county surveyor is interested in any survey to be made, the judge of the superior court or the judge of the probate court of the county in which the land is located, upon the application of any party in interest, shall appoint a competent, disinterested surveyor or, in his discretion, may appoint the surveyor of any adjoining county to make the survey. If the surveyor appointed is not a county surveyor, before entering on the survey, he shall subscribe before some judicial officer of the county the oath required of county surveyors. The rights, powers, and duties of the surveyor so appointed shall be the same as those of the county surveyor. The return of the surveyor shall have the same force and effect as do other surveys.

          <content>
            <p>§ 36-71-2. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Capital improvement" means an improvement with a useful life of ten years or more, by new construction or other action, which increases the service capacity of a public facility.

(2)  "Capital improvements element" means a component of a comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to Chapter 70 of this title which sets out projected needs for system improvements during a planning horizon established in the comprehensive plan, a schedule of capital improvements that will meet the anticipated need for system improvements, and a description of anticipated funding sources for each required improvement.

(3)  "Comprehensive plan" has the same meaning as provided for in Chapter 70 of this title.

(4)  "Developer" means any person or legal entity undertaking development.

(5)  "Development" means any construction or expansion of a building, structure, or use, any change in use of a building or structure, or any change in the use of land, any of which creates additional demand and need for public facilities.

(6)  "Development approval" means any written authorization from a municipality or county which authorizes the commencement of construction.

(7)  "Development exaction" means a requirement attached to a development approval or other municipal or county action approving or authorizing a particular development project, including but not limited to a rezoning, which requirement compels the payment, dedication, or contribution of goods, services, land, or money as a condition of approval.

(8)  "Development impact fee" means a payment of money imposed upon development as a condition of development approval to pay for a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements needed to serve new growth and development.

(9)  "Encumber" means to legally obligate by contract or otherwise commit to use by appropriation or other official act of a municipality or county.

(10)  "Feepayor" means that person who pays a development impact fee or his successor in interest where the right or entitlement to any refund of previously paid development impact fees which is required by this chapter has been expressly transferred or assigned to the successor in interest. In the absence of an express transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to any refund of previously paid development impact fees, the right or entitlement shall be deemed "not to run with the land."

(11)  "Governmental entity" means any water authority, water and sewer authority, or water or waste-water authority created by or pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly of Georgia.

(13)  "Present value" means the current value of past, present, or future payments, contributions or dedications of goods, services, materials, construction, or money.

(14)  "Project" means a particular development on an identified parcel of land.

(15)  "Project improvements" means site improvements and facilities that are planned and designed to provide service for a particular development project and that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the project and are not system improvements. The character of the improvement shall control a determination of whether an improvement is a project improvement or system improvement and the physical location of the improvement on site or off site shall not be considered determinative of whether an improvement is a project improvement or a system improvement. If an improvement or facility provides or will provide more than incidental service or facilities capacity to persons other than users or occupants of a particular project, the improvement or facility is a system improvement and shall not be considered a project improvement. No improvement or facility included in a plan for public facilities approved by the governing body of the municipality or county shall be considered a project improvement.

(16)  "Proportionate share" means that portion of the cost of system improvements which is reasonably related to the service demands and needs of the project within the defined service area.(17)  "Public facilities" means:

(1)  Upon the request of an owner of property on which a development impact fee has been paid, a municipality or county shall refund the development impact fee if capacity is available and service is denied or if the municipality or county, after collecting the fee when service is not available, has failed to encumber the development impact fee or commence construction within six years after the date that the fee was collected. In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis;

(2)  When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber development impact fees, the municipality or county shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given notice to the municipality or county of a transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address.  Such notice shall also be published within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fees were collected and shall contain the heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund";

(3)  An application for a refund shall be made within one year of the time such refund becomes payable under paragraph (1) or (2) of this Code section or within one year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund under this Code section, whichever is later;

(4)  A refund shall include a refund of a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess development impact fee collected;

(5)  All refunds shall be made to the feepayor within 60 days after it is determined by a municipality or county that a sufficient proof of claim for a refund has been made; and

(6)  The feepayor shall have standing to sue for a refund under the provisions of this chapter if there has been a timely application for a refund and the refund has been denied or has not been made within one year of submission of the application for refund to the collecting municipality or county.

Each authority created by this chapter is created for nonprofit and public purposes; and it is found, determined, and declared that the creation of each such authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that the authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this chapter. For such reasons, the state covenants the holders of the bonds issued under this chapter that such authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments imposed by the state or any of its counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts upon any property acquired by the authority or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or leased by it to others; or upon its activities in the operation or maintenance of any such property or on any income derived by the authority in the form of fees, recording fees, rentals, charges, purchase price, installments, or otherwise; and that the bonds of such authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within the state. The tax exemption provided in this Code section shall not include any exemption from sales and use tax on property purchased by the authority or for use by the authority.

The authority, in such instruments, may provide for the pledging of all or any part of its revenues, income, or charges and for the mortgaging, encumbering, or conveying of all or any part of its real or personal property; may covenant against pledging any or all of its revenues, income, or charges; and may further provide for the disposition of proceeds realized from the sale of any bonds and bond anticipation notes, for the replacement of lost, destroyed, stolen, or mutilated bonds and notes, and for the payment and redemption of such bonds and notes. Similarly, subject to the limitations and procedures of this Code section, undertakings of an authority may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders and noteholders may enforce rights against the authority and provide for rights upon breach of any covenant, condition, or obligation of the authority. Bonds, resolutions, trust indentures, mortgages, or deeds to secure obligations executed by an authority and bond anticipation notes executed by an authority may contain such provisions not otherwise contrary to law as the authority shall deem necessary or desirable.</p>

The authority may issue notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated.

              <p>Each affected local governing authority may, no more than once annually, audit the business records of the state franchise holder to the extent necessary to ensure payment in accordance with this Code section. For purposes of this subsection, an audit shall be defined as a comprehensive review of the records of the holder of a state franchise. Once any audited period of a state franchise holder has been the subject of a requested audit, such audited period of such state franchise holder shall not again be the subject of any audit. In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of the franchise fee due to an affected local governing authority under this Code section, an action may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by an affected local governing authority seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due or by a state franchise holder seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment; provided, however, that any such action shall be brought within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates. Such time period may be extended by written agreement between the state issued franchise holder and such affected local governing authority. Each party shall bear the party's own costs incurred in connection with any such examination or dispute. In the event that an affected local governing authority files an action to recover alleged underpayments of franchise fees and a court of competent jurisdiction determines the cable service provider or video service provider has underpaid franchise fees due for any 12 month period by 10 percent or more, the cable service provider or video service provider may be required to pay the affected local governing authority its reasonable costs associated with the audit along with any franchise fee underpayments; provided, however, late payments shall not apply.</p>

                <p>Subject to the usage criteria set forth in this subsection, a municipal or county governing authority that does not have PEG access channels activated under the incumbent service provider's franchise agreement as of January 1, 2008, may request a sufficient amount of capacity on its network to support up to three PEG channels for a municipality in this state having a population of 50,000 or more according to the United States decennial census of 2000 or any future such census or an unincorporated area of a county which is located in a county in this state having a population of 50,000 or more according to the United States decennial census of 2000 or any future such census or up to two PEG channels for a municipality in this state having a population of 50,000 or less according to the United States decennial census of 2000 or any future such census or an unincorporated area of a county which is located in a county in this state having a population of 50,000 or less according to the United States decennial census of 2000, and the cable service provider or video service provider shall designate such sufficient amount of capacity. No cable service provider or video service provider shall be required to provide more than three PEG access channels on its network within a municipality or unincorporated area of a county if there does not exist at the time of the state franchise more than three active PEG channels in such municipality or unincorporated area of the county.</p>

            <p>§ 36-76-9. Service outlet to municipalities and counties; complimentary basic cable service or video service to public schools and public libraries
A cable service provider or video service provider shall, upon written request by a municipality or county, install, at no charge, one service outlet to a demarcation point located on the outside of any designated municipal or county building or multibuilding complex, provided such building demarcation point is within 125 feet from the cable service provider or video service provider's activated distribution point of connection. A cable service provider or video service provider shall not be required to extend its facilities beyond the appropriate demarcation point located outside the building or to perform any inside wiring. The cable service provider or video service provider shall provide complimentary basic cable service or video service to public schools and public libraries over that one service outlet free of charge, which service shall not be used for commercial purposes. The cable service provider or video service provider shall provide complimentary basic cable service or video service to public buildings other than public schools and public libraries only to the extent such a complimentary service arrangement existed under the terms of a local franchise agreement in effect as of January 1, 2007, and shall continue only until the local franchise agreement would have expired under its own terms; provided, however, that such provider shall not be precluded from providing such additional complimentary service at its option. The municipality or county may not receive service at the same building from more than one cable service provider or video service provider at a time under this Code section.

              <p>To the extent that the Constitution of Georgia permits the General Assembly by law to further define the powers and duties of any local government authority, as defined in Code Section 36-80-16, whose purpose includes the public purpose of developing or promoting trade, commerce, or industry, and to enlarge or restrict the same, each such local government authority is authorized and shall have the power to finance (by loan, grant, lease, or otherwise), refinance, construct, erect, assemble, purchase, acquire, own, repair, remodel, renovate, rehabilitate, modify, maintain, extend, improve, install, sell, equip, expand, add to, operate, or manage projects and to pay the cost of any project from the proceeds of revenue bonds of such a local government authority or any other funds of such local government authority, or from any contributions or loans by persons, corporations, limited or general partnerships, or other entities, all of which such a local government authority is authorized to receive, accept, and use. To the extent that any project serves a governmental function, the General Assembly finds and determines that such a project by its nature comprises both public and private components that are integrated so as to produce the desired public purpose and that therefore carrying out such a project is proper and authorized for such a local government authority under the Constitution of Georgia.

              <p>The General Assembly finds and determines that there is a pressing need for modernization and reorganization of local government service delivery programs in many parts of the state.  Both increasing population and urbanization in some areas of the state, as well as relative population decreases in other areas of the state, together with modern developments in transportation, communication, information, and other service delivery equipment and systems have rendered obsolete many of the traditional local government territorial systems for delivery of local government services.</p>

              <p>In many cases the consolidation of local government units or the consolidation of local government service delivery programs can lead to increased efficiency in the delivery of local government services, thereby providing either enhanced service delivery, lower levels of taxation, or both. In other cases, however, existing territorial systems for local government service delivery already operate in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p>

The General Assembly finds and determines that there is a need for revitalization in many areas of Georgia. Revitalization will improve geographic areas within cities and counties which are suffering from disinvestment, underdevelopment, and economic decline and will encourage private businesses to reinvest and rehabilitate such areas. The General Assembly recognizes that increased employment opportunities for the citizens of Georgia will assist in the implementation of welfare reform. It is the intent of the General Assembly that this chapter be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes.

            <p>§ 36-88-5. Designation of enterprise zones
A local governing body or bodies may designate one or more geographic areas as enterprise zones. In such enterprise zone, local ad valorem taxes, occupation taxes, license fees, and other local fees and taxes, except local sales and use taxes or any combination thereof, may be exempted or reduced from applying to qualified business and service enterprises in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A joint resolution by a county and one or more municipalities may provide such exemptions for jointly designated enterprise zones. Any areas designated as an enterprise zone may be redesignated as an enterprise zone after the expiration of its initial term as an enterprise zone if the area continues to meet the criteria for an enterprise zone contained in this chapter.

            <p>§ 36-9-4. Maintenance of insurance on books of laws and court reports
The officer having charge of the financial affairs of each county shall keep insured, at a fair valuation against loss by fire, all volumes of the public laws and decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals which have been furnished to the judge of the probate court and the clerk of the superior court of his county. Such policies of insurance shall be in the name of the county. The premiums therefor shall be paid out of the funds of the county. In the event of any loss or damage by fire, the county governing authority shall proceed to collect the amount of loss on the policy; when so collected, the proceeds thereof shall be used in supplying new books of the kind lost or injured, insofar as the proceeds may be sufficient to do so.

              <p>Before a franchising authority may begin the authorization process of permitting a public provider to deliver service, the franchising authority must notify each private provider serving the targeted market that the franchising authority intends to begin the process of authorizing a public provider to provide cable service. The notice must state that the private provider is not meeting the present and future needs of the community and shall set forth each such unmet need separately and fully in order that the private provider may reasonably ascertain the scope and nature of the issues identified by the franchising authority. The franchising authority must allow each private provider 30 days to present a plan to address the identified needs not being met, including a reasonable period of time to implement the plan. Neither the notification nor response to the notification provided for in this subsection shall affect the franchise agreement between a private provider and a franchising authority.</p>

            <p>§ 36-90-4. Accounting methods regarding the cost of providing service; cross-subsidization prohibited
On and after January 1, 2000, each public provider shall prepare and maintain records in accordance with generally accepted governmental accounting principles which record the full cost accounting of providing service. Such records shall show the amount and source of capital, including working capital, utilized in providing service. Nothing contained in this chapter shall preclude a public provider utilizing capital from any lawful source, including the public provider's general funds, provided that the reasonable cost of such capital is accounted for as a cost of providing the service. No public provider shall cross-subsidize the costs of providing service. A public provider shall impute into its indirect costs of providing service an amount for franchise fees, regulatory fees, occupation taxes, pole attachment fees, and ad valorem property taxes, calculated in the same manner as such amounts are calculated for any private provider paying such costs to the public provider in the same service area.
