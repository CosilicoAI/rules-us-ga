(1)  When any person required to file a report as provided by this title fails to file the report within the time prescribed, he shall be assessed a penalty of $50.00 for each failure to file.

(2)  In the event the commissioner determines, upon inspection of the invoices, books, and records of a licensed wholesale dealer or importer or from any other information obtained by him or his authorized agents, that the licensed wholesale dealer or importer has not paid the proper tax or the proper amount of taxes, the wholesale dealer or importer shall be assessed for the taxes due. After assessment, the person assessed shall be provided with notice and an opportunity for a hearing as provided for contested cases by Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act."

(3)  When any person fails to pay any tax or license fee due as provided by this title, the person shall be assessed a penalty the same as that provided for in Code Section 48-2-44.

(4)  When any person fails to file a return, files a false or fraudulent return, or when a tax deficiency or any part of a tax deficiency is due to a fraudulent intent to evade any tax imposed or authorized by this title, the person shall be assessed a specific penalty of 50 percent of the tax due.

(5)  When any person fails to pay the tax or any part of the tax due as provided by this title, the person shall pay interest on the unpaid tax at the rate of 1 percent per month from the time the tax became due until paid or at the rate specified in Code Section 48-2-40, whichever is greater. Interest shall be computed on a monthly basis for any portion of a month during which payment is delinquent.

(6)  All penalties and interest imposed by this title shall be payable to and collected by the commissioner in the same manner as if they were a part of the taxes imposed by this title.

As used in this paragraph, the term "festival" means a specific outdoor public celebration or gathering for which a license or permit has been issued by the appropriate governing authority which involves the use either of public parks or public streets and which includes entertainment, dancing, music, dramatic productions, art exhibition, parades, or the sale of merchandise, food or alcohol, or any combination of the foregoing; and which of necessity requires for its successful execution the provision and coordination of municipal services to a degree significantly over and above that which the city routinely provides under ordinary everyday circumstances.  The definition of "festival," as used in this paragraph, does not include events which are solely parades, foot races, or political demonstrations unless such parade, foot race, or political demonstration is proposed as an integral part of a larger "festival," as defined in this paragraph.</p>

Upon violation of a term or condition of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed accordingly. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge such person and dismiss the proceedings against him or her. Discharge and dismissal under this subsection shall be without court adjudication of guilt and shall not be deemed a conviction for purposes of this subsection or for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime.

            <p>§ 3-3-31. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds, determines, and declares that the direct shipment of alcoholic beverages by persons in the business of selling alcoholic beverages in other states or countries to residents of this state in violation of this title poses a serious threat to the public health, safety, revenue, and the economy of Georgia. The General Assembly further finds, determines, and declares that the present penalties for illegal direct shipments of alcoholic beverages to residents of this state are inadequate to ensure compliance with the provisions of this title and that the measures provided for in Code Section 3-3-32 are fully consistent with the powers conferred upon the State of Georgia by the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

With respect to malt beverages shipped from outside this state to a destination within this state, possession in the consignee occurs when the malt beverage first physically enters the state or when the risk of loss from destruction or casualty to the malt beverage is shifted from the consignor to the consignee located in this state, in accordance with the contract of the parties and the substantive commercial laws of this state, whichever event occurs first.

            <p>§ 3-6-4. Removal of partially consumed bottle of wine from premises
Notwithstanding any other contrary provision of law, any restaurant which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises may permit a patron to remove one unsealed bottle of wine per patron for consumption off premises, if the patron has purchased a meal and consumed a portion of the bottle of wine which has been purchased on the premises with such meal on the restaurant's premises. A partially consumed bottle of wine that is to be removed from the premises must be securely resealed by the licensee or its employees before removal from the premises. The partially consumed bottle of wine shall be placed in a bag or other container that is secured in such a manner that it is visibly apparent if the container has been subsequently opened or tampered with, and a dated receipt for the bottle of wine and meal shall be provided by the licensee and attached to the container. If transported in a motor vehicle, the container with the resealed bottle of wine shall be placed in a locked glove compartment, a locked trunk, or the area behind the last upright seat of a motor vehicle that is not equipped with a trunk.

            <p>§ 3-6-21.2. Sunday sales on farm wineries; off-site sales; sales in "special entertainment districts."
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title to the contrary, in all counties in which the sale of wine is lawful by a farm winery and in all municipalities in which the sale of wine is lawful by a farm winery, a farm winery which is licensed to sell its wine in a tasting room or other licensed farm winery facility within the county or municipality, as the case may be, for consumption on the premises or in closed packages for consumption off the premises shall be authorized to sell its wine and the wine of any other Georgia farm winery licensee on Sundays from 12:30 P.M. until 12:00 Midnight in a tasting room or other licensed farm winery facility, to the same extent as its county or municipal license would otherwise permit; provided, however, that if such sales of wine on Sundays are lawful at a time earlier than 12:30 P.M. within the county or municipality in which the licensed premises of the Georgia farm winery is located, the Georgia farm winery shall be authorized to sell its wine and the wine of any other Georgia farm winery licensee beginning at such earlier time. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed so as to authorize a farm winery to sell wine as provided in this Code section on any other premises which are not actually located on the property where such farm wine is produced, except in special entertainment districts designated by the local governing authority of the county or municipality, as applicable.
