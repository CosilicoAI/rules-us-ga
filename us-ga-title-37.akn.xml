The General Assembly further finds that the state has an obligation and a responsibility to develop and implement planning and service delivery systems which focus on a core set of consumer oriented, community based values and principles which include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

              <p>Local governments, specifically county governing authorities, have provided outstanding leadership and support for mental health, developmental disability, and addictive disease programs, and the General Assembly finds that their investments, both personal and capital, should be valued and utilized in any improved system. As such, the state and any new governing structure should take special precautions to ensure that the county governing authorities have an expanded level of input into decision making and resource allocation and that any services or programs should continue to use and expand their use of county facilities and resources wherever appropriate and possible.</p>

              <p>The department, with the approval of the commissioner, shall designate community service board areas, which shall serve as boundaries for the establishment of community service boards within this state for the purpose of delivering disability services. The department shall be authorized to initiate the redesignation of such community service board area boundaries and may consider requests from a county or group of counties or a community service board or a group of community service boards for recommended changes to the boundaries of the community service board areas. The department, with the approval of the commissioner, is authorized to redesignate two or more community service board areas as a single community service board area. Two or more community service boards may request that the department, with the approval of the commissioner, merge the community service board areas served by such boards into a single community service board area. If the department, with the approval of the commissioner, authorizes the redesignation or merging of community services board areas pursuant to this paragraph, the assets, equipment, and resources of such community service boards shall become the assets, equipment, and resources of the reconstituted community service board serving the successor single board area. It is the intent of the General Assembly not to limit a community service board to serving only those counties within the boundaries of its community service board area.</p>

              <p>To the extent practicable, the boundaries for regional planning boards and offices and community service areas shall not subdivide any county unit. In dividing the state into areas, the board and the department shall take into consideration such factors as geographic boundaries, roads and other means of transportation, population concentrations, city and county lines, other relevant community services, and community economic and social relationships. Consideration shall also be given to the existence of facilities and personnel available in the areas for the delivery of disability services.

              <p>It is the goal of the State of Georgia that every citizen be provided an adequate level of disability care through a unified system of disability services. To this end, the department shall, to the maximum extent possible, allocate funds available for services so as to provide an adequate disability services program available to all citizens of this state. In funding and providing disability services, the department and the regional offices shall ensure that all providers, public or private, meet minimum standards of quality and competency as established by the department.</p>

The department shall be responsible for developing procedures to properly account for the collection, remittance, and reporting of generated fees. The department shall work with the community service boards and other public or private providers to develop an appropriate mechanism for accounting for the funds and resources contributed to local disability services by counties and municipalities within the area. Such contributions are not required to be submitted to either the community service boards or the department; however, appropriate documentation and accounting entries shall make certain that the county or municipality is credited, and if necessary compensated, appropriately for such contribution of funds or resources.</p>

The department shall develop a state-wide sliding fee scale for the provision of disability services and shall promulgate standards that define emergency disability services and refusal to pay.

In nonemergency situations, no female patient shall be transported at any time without another female in attendance who is not a patient, unless such female patient is accompanied by her husband, father, adult brother, or adult son.</p>

              <p>of this Code section, when a patient is under the care of a facility, the facility shall have the discretion to determine the type of vehicle to safely transport the patient and to arrange for such transportation without the need to obtain the prior approval of the governing authority of the county of the patient's residence, the court, or the community mental health center. This subsection shall not prevent the facility from requesting and receiving transportation services from the governing authority of the county of the patient's residence and shall not relieve the county sheriff of the duty of providing transportation. Persons providing transportation are authorized to transport a patient from a sending facility to a receiving facility but shall not release the patient under any circumstances except into the custody of the receiving facility. The use of physical restraints to ensure the safe transport of the patient shall comply with the requirements of Code Section 37-3-165. When transportation is not provided by the county sheriff, the expense of such transportation shall not be billed to the county governing authority but may be billed to the patient and, unless agreed to in writing by the facility, shall not be billed to or considered an obligation of the facility.

Upon notification from the superintendent or the chief medical officer of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center for those patients therein who may require involuntary treatment pursuant to this chapter, the patient will be evaluated, while remaining in the physical custody of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, by the nearest emergency receiving facility. The superintendent and chief medical officer of any hospital or institution operated by such agency in which the individual is so hospitalized shall, with respect to such individual, be vested with the same powers and duties as the superintendent and chief medical officer of facilities within this state with respect to all matters under this chapter. Jurisdiction is retained in the appropriate courts of this state at any time to inquire into the mental condition of an individual so hospitalized to determine the necessity for continuance of his hospitalization and to order his release; and every transfer of a patient by the department pursuant to this Code section is so conditioned.</p>

Upon application to the department by a parent, spouse, next of kin, or guardian or by an agency of another state in which the patient is hospitalized, a patient shall be eligible to be hospitalized in the State of Georgia if found by the department to be a legal resident of this state. The department shall designate a hospital to which such patient is to be transported at no expense to the State of Georgia. The regional state hospital administrator of such hospital and the next of kin or guardian of the patient shall be notified of this action. The chief medical officer shall be authorized to hospitalize the patient for a period not to exceed five days unless prior to the expiration of such period the patient shall have voluntarily agreed to hospitalization or involuntary proceedings shall have been instituted under this chapter. After a thorough physical and mental examination has been made by the medical staff of such hospital, the chief medical officer of the hospital or his designee is authorized to sign an application for involuntary hospitalization if necessary. Such application shall be forwarded to the court of the county in which that hospital is located for action pursuant to the provisions of this chapter relative thereto.

            <p>§ 37-3-104. Procedure upon discovery that a patient hospitalized in Georgia is not a resident
If a hospitalized patient is discovered not to be a resident, the regional state hospital administrator of the treatment facility in which the patient is hospitalized shall seek his transfer to the custody of authorities of the state of his residence or to a publicly owned or publicly operated psychiatric hospital in that state. Notwithstanding an individual's status as a nonresident, nothing contained in this Code section shall prevent the voluntary hospitalization of such individual under this chapter for which due payment is made by such individual or others on his behalf nor shall it prevent the transfer, custody, care, or treatment of such individual in accordance with the terms of any reciprocal agreement between the State of Georgia and any other state, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States. This Code section shall not apply to persons confined to any facility operated by or under the control of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or any other federal agency.

This subsection shall not prevent the facility from requesting and receiving transportation services from the governing authority of the county of the client's residence and shall not relieve the county sheriff of the duty of providing transportation. Persons providing transportation are authorized to transport a patient from a sending facility to a receiving facility but shall not release the client under any circumstances except into the custody of the receiving facility. The use of physical restraints to ensure the safe transport of the client shall comply with the requirements of Code Section 37-4-124. When transportation is not provided by the county sheriff, the expense of such transportation shall not be billed to the county governing authority but may be billed to the client and, unless agreed to in writing by the facility, shall not be billed to or considered an obligation of the facility.

Jurisdiction is retained in the appropriate courts of this state at any time to inquire into the condition of such an individual, to determine the necessity for continuance of his care in said facility, and to order his release; and every such person shall retain the rights delineated in Code Section 37-4-100.

The regional state hospital administrator of such facility and the next of kin or guardian of the person shall be notified of this action. The regional state hospital administrator shall be authorized to accept the person for a period not to exceed five days, unless prior to the expiration of such period proceedings have been initiated under Code Section 37-4-42 for an order to receive services from the department. After a thorough physical and mental examination has been made by the medical staff of such facility, the regional state hospital administrator of the facility or his designee is authorized to initiate a petition under this chapter, if this is necessary. Such application shall be forwarded to the court of the county in which that facility is located for action pursuant to this chapter in relation thereto.

Since the State of Georgia accepts a responsibility for its developmentally disabled citizens and an obligation to them which it must discharge, facilities, programs, and services shall be made available to meet the needs of each developmentally disabled person during his entire lifetime. The primary purpose of this chapter shall be to provide community based alternatives to total institutional care so that developmentally disabled individuals can continue to live in their home communities.

            <p>§ 37-5-3. Community services defined
As used in this chapter, the term "community services" means a coordinated, consumer and family centered, consumer and family directed, and comprehensive system of community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that enable individuals with developmental disabilities to exercise self-determination, be independent, be productive, and be integrated and included in all facets of community life. Such services shall include those deemed reasonably necessary by the department to provide for education, training, rehabilitation, and care of individuals with developmental disabilities and shall include but not be limited to: diagnostic and evaluation services; day-care and training services; work-activity services; support coordination, day support, and personal support services; supportive employment services; community residential services such as group family-care homes, community living arrangements, and host homes; transportation services incidental to educational, training, and rehabilitation services; technology and durable equipment support and services; social services; medical services; and specified home services.

            <p>§ 37-6-6. Inspection and approval of day-care centers
The department is authorized, directed, and empowered (1) to inspect day-care centers for the developmentally disabled in order to determine compliance with departmental standards for such centers and (2) to approve those day-care centers which meet minimum departmental standards for matching funds under Code Section 37-6-2 or grants-in-aid under Code Section 37-6-4. Inspection shall include both those centers now in operation and those which will begin operation in the future. Reinspections may be made at any time and approval may be withdrawn whenever circumstances indicate that a day-care center no longer meets departmental standards. If approval is withdrawn, it cannot be reinstated until the deficiencies have been corrected and a satisfactory reinspection has been made. After a day-care center has been approved by the department and a certificate of approval has been issued, the center is not subject to examination, approval, or licensing by any other department, agency, or division of the state.

When transportation is not provided by the county sheriff, the expense of such transportation shall not be billed to the county governing authority but may be billed to the patient and, unless agreed to in writing by the facility, shall not be billed to or considered an obligation of the facility.

            <p>§ 37-7-103. Procedure for transfer of Georgia residents from out-of-state hospitals to Georgia hospitals
Upon application to the department by a parent, spouse, next of kin, or guardian or by an agency of another state in which the patient is hospitalized, a patient shall be eligible to be hospitalized in the State of Georgia if found by the department to be a legal resident of this state. The department shall designate a hospital to which such patient is to be transported at no expense to the State of Georgia. The regional state hospital administrator of such hospital and the next of kin or guardian of the patient shall be notified of this action. The chief medical officer shall be authorized to hospitalize the patient for a period not to exceed five days unless prior to the expiration of such period the patient shall have voluntarily agreed to hospitalization or involuntary proceedings shall have been instituted under this chapter. After a thorough physical and mental examination has been made by the medical staff of such hospital, the chief medical officer of the hospital or his designee is authorized to sign an application for involuntary hospitalization if necessary. Such application shall be forwarded to the court of the county in which that hospital is located for action pursuant to the provisions of this chapter relative thereto.

This Code section shall not apply to persons confined to any facility operated by or under the control of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or any other federal agency.

            <p>§ 37-9-2. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Assessment" means a determination by the department of the amount payable by the persons liable for cost of care for services rendered to a patient; such amount shall be either the full cost of care or, if applicable, the amount payable toward cost of care, determined in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 37-9-5.  It is expressly provided that there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the full cost of care is to be imposed. This presumption shall prevail until testimony, documentation, or evidence is provided pursuant to other provisions of this chapter.

(2)  "Cost of care" means the costs incurred for the support, care, and treatment of each individual patient or the per patient average of such costs as determined by the department on the basis of the estimated current operating costs of the hospital or an identifiable part or section thereof providing such services.(3)  "Income," except for patients who are residents of other states, means that amount determined by adding to the gross income as now or hereafter defined in Georgia income tax laws, minus deductions and personal exemptions as authorized by such income tax laws, the items listed in this paragraph, if such items are not already included in gross income as defined above.  For a patient who is a resident of another state, "income" means the same as above except no deductions will be made for any deductions or personal exemptions as authorized by Georgia income tax laws. The following items are to be added, respectively:
(A)  Any amounts received by or on behalf of the person liable for cost of care from accident insurance or workers' compensation for total or partial incapacity to work, plus the amount of any damages received by or on behalf of the person liable for cost of care, whether by suit or agreement, on account of such injuries or sickness;

(B)  The net income from property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent;

(C)  Interest upon obligations of the United States government or of this state or of a political subdivision thereof;

(D)  The net income from individual holdings of stock in banks and trust companies incorporated under the banking laws of this state or of the United States;

(E)  Retirement income, social security benefits, veterans' benefits, and any other benefits that could be applied for the support of the patient;

(F)  The net income from any other assets, including but not limited to personal property, real property, or mixed property, and any other property or estate wherever located and in whatever form, inclusive of any assets sold or transferred within a period of 90 days prior to the date services were first rendered to the patient by a hospital.

(4)  "Patient" means any person who is admitted to or who receives services from a state hospital.(5)  "Persons liable for cost of care" means:
(A)  The patient or his estate;

(B)  The patient's spouse;

(C)  The parent or parents of any patient under 18 years of age;

(D)  Any fiduciary or representative payee holding assets for the patient or on his behalf, including, in his representative capacity, the guardian, trustee, executor, or administrator of any trust, estate, inheritance, or fund in which a patient has a legal or beneficial interest;

(E)  Any person, if not otherwise liable, listed as the insured member of a contract, plan, or benefit to the extent that such contract, plan, or benefit provides payment of hospitalization, medical expenses, and other health care services for the patient as a covered beneficiary or dependent;

(F)  A stepparent or any other person residing with and providing support of a patient under 18 years of age who has not been legally adopted by such individual, with maximum liability limited to the amount such stepparent or other individual is authorized by Georgia income tax laws to claim as a standard deduction and personal exemption for the patient; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to liability pursuant to other provisions of this chapter regarding hospital, health, and other medical insurance, program, or plan benefits or subrogation rights.

(6)  "State hospital" means any state hospital which now or hereafter comes under the control of the department and any facility operated in conjunction therewith.

            <p>§ 37-9-4. Liability of patient for cost of care; time of payment; inability of department to collect assessment from patient or failure of patient's assessment to cover cost of care
Each patient receiving services from a state hospital shall be legally responsible for, and shall pay to the department, the cost of his care received from a state hospital. Payments for cost of care shall be payable following the receipt of services in accordance with standards and procedures established by the board. In the event the department is unable to collect the assessment from the patient or in the event the patient's assessment is less than the full cost of care for such patient, all other persons liable for the cost of care for such patient shall pay to the department their respective assessments as provided by Code Section 37-9-5.

Failure of the patient or other persons liable for cost of care to provide financial information to the department required to determine assessments on the basis of ability to pay in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 37-9-6 or failure of the patient or other persons liable for cost of care to cooperate with the department in obtaining payment of any insurance or health benefits available for a patient may result in assessment of such persons of the full cost of care of the patient.  Failure of the patient or other persons liable for cost of care to cooperate with the department in applying on behalf of the patient for federal benefits and insurance, program, or plan benefits in order that a determination may be made of eligibility for such benefits may also result in assessment of such persons of the full cost of care of the patient and the burden of providing information to reduce the full cost of care is on the patient or other persons liable for cost of care.</p>

              <p>It shall be the duty of the department to reexamine the assessment periodically and either reduce or increase such assessment as hereinafter provided in accordance with changes in the ability to pay of the person liable for cost of care. If the department determines that the economic circumstances of a person liable for cost of care have improved to an extent justifying an increase in the assessment, any such increase shall apply only to cost of care for services rendered for the patient after the effective date of the increase in assessment and no such increase shall cause the assessment to exceed the total cost of care. The department may not increase an assessment as provided in this Code section without affording the person liable for cost of care an opportunity for a hearing on the question of the increase in the assessment. A person liable for cost of care may apply to the department for a change in the assessment when the person's economic circumstances have changed sufficiently to affect adversely his future ability to pay. If an assessment for services previously rendered for a patient is being paid in accordance with a scheduled plan of payments approved by the department, then a reduction in assessment because of a change in the economic circumstances affecting adversely the ability to pay of the person liable for cost of care may apply to that portion of the assessment for services previously rendered for the patient which remain unpaid as of the date of the reduction of the assessment as well as to the assessment for cost of services rendered after the date of the reduction. However, no such reduction shall require the refund of any payments made on an assessment prior to the date of the reduction of the assessment. After investigation and hearing, the department shall act upon the application made by the person liable for cost of care.

            <p>§ 37-9-6. Standards for determination of assessments for less than full cost of care
The board shall establish standards for determining assessments when such assessments are less than the full cost of care. Such standards shall be based on the income, assets, and other circumstances of the persons liable for cost of care and shall include consideration of the number of dependents, as defined under Georgia income tax law and regulations; legal rights to payment under any insurance agreement, and</p>

            <content>
              <p>of Code Section 37-9-8. In determining assessments for persons liable for cost of care, the department shall develop procedures to ensure that no dependent, deduction, or personal exemption as defined by Georgia income tax law will be reflected more than once in the determination of assessments for any one patient. In establishing standards to determine such assessments, the board shall adopt criteria to be applied uniformly to all persons liable for cost of care, except that the board may adopt separate criteria for assessing monthly benefits or funds from any source to cover cost of care, support, and treatment provided to patients who are hospitalized for longer than three months and whose current needs, as defined by the Social Security Administration, are being met. However, the board shall ensure that the assessment made each month shall allow the recipients of such benefits or funds to retain at a minimum an amount as a personal allowance equal to the amount of the personal needs allowance allowed beneficiaries under the state medical assistance plan. Further, such standards will include special provisions for assessing developmental disabilities respite care allowed by law or duly adopted departmental regulations, where such admissions are legally limited to 56 days of care a year. To the extent practicable, such criteria shall ensure that persons having the same or substantially the same financial ability to pay cost of care shall have the same or substantially the same financial obligation to pay such cost of care.

            <p>§ 37-9-9. Exhaustion of benefits under other programs or plans required prior to expenditure of public funds; determination of assessments; assignment of benefits; subrogation
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the department shall not be required to expend public funds for the purpose of providing support, care, and treatment covered under this chapter to any patient until such patient has exhausted his or her eligibility and receipt of benefits under all other existing or future private, public, local, state, or federal programs or plans. Before the department expends public funds for a patient's cost of care, the department may assess and recover the cost of a patient's care from the patient or other persons liable for such patient's cost of care if such patient is eligible for benefits under any other program or plan.  In the event the patient is covered by an insurance contract or any other plan or benefit of any nature providing for payment of hospitalization, medical expenses, and other health care services or any combination thereof, such patient or other person liable for the cost of care of such patient shall pay or cause to have paid from such insurance, plan, or benefit without deduction, exemptions, or credits, the full cost of care of the patient, or that portion thereof covered by such insurance, plan, or benefit. The assessment for cost of care of the patient made by the department pursuant to Code Section 37-9-5 shall be for the total amount payable by such insurance, plan, or benefit up to the total cost of care or for that portion of cost of care payable by such insurance, plan, or benefit; and if the proceeds from such insurance, plan, or benefit are less than the total cost of care, such assessment shall include an assessment based on the remaining balance, except where full payment of the balance or a portion thereof is required by a health insurance program or other plan or benefit, in which case the balance or at least the required portion thereof will be the assessment. Further, the department shall comply with all federally funded health and medical insurance programs which require established amounts payable by beneficiaries and is authorized to accept amounts payable toward cost of care under any insurance program, plan, or benefit if paid according to the provisions of such programs, plans, or benefits even though the amounts payable may exceed cost of care amounts as provided by this chapter. The department shall develop procedures to apply the provisions of this chapter, specifically Code Section 37-9-5, to any amounts which remain payable by the patient or beneficiaries under a federally funded health and medical insurance program, provided that the application of any such procedures does not invalidate payment of benefits under the program.  For the purpose of carrying out this Code section, the department is authorized to accept assignment of benefits payable under such insurance, plans, or benefits; but the department shall not require the assignment of such benefits as a condition precedent to the admission of a patient to a hospital or as a condition precedent to providing services for such patient.  In order to collect maximum benefits payable toward cost of care, the department is authorized to contract with any insurance program, plan, or benefit to become a participating member hospital if payments are not made or are made at a lesser than full coverage amount to nonparticipating members.  Moreover, the department or its designated agents will have subrogation rights to the recovery of a patient's cost of care that the patient or other person liable for the patient's cost of care may have against any person, estate, organization, entity, or plan.  Further, if any patient or other person liable for the cost of a patient's care receives benefits or funds in settlement, judgment, or otherwise for any health care, medical expenses, or hospitalization or other care directly related to services and care provided by the department to a patient, the patient or other person liable for cost of care will pay or cause to have paid the full cost of care or that portion thereof recovered which is directly related to the care provided by the department.  This right of subrogation is cumulative and in addition to any other remedy and this right shall be available for any enforcement or collection process which is contemplated under other provisions of this chapter.
