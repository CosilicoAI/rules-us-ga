"Notice to the Buyer

   Do not sign this before you read it or if it contains any blank spaces. You are entitled to an exact copy of the paper you sign. You have the right to pay in advance the full amount due."
A copy of any such account shall be delivered or mailed to the retail buyer by the retail seller prior to the date on which the first payment is due thereunder. Any acknowledgment by the buyer of delivery of a copy of the account shall be in clear and conspicuous type and, if contained in the account, shall appear directly above the buyer's signature. No account shall be signed by the buyer when it contains blank spaces to be filled in after it has been signed. The buyer's acknowledgment, conforming to the requirements of this subsection, of delivery of a copy of an account shall be presumptive proof in any action or proceeding of such delivery and that the account, when signed, did not contain any blank spaces as provided in this subsection. A revolving account shall be presumed to be signed or accepted by the buyer if, after a request for a revolving account, such revolving account or application for a revolving account is in fact signed by the buyer or if such revolving account is used by the buyer or if such revolving account is used by another person authorized by the buyer to use it. The revolving account is not effective until: the buyer has received the disclosures required pursuant to the federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1601, et seq., as amended;</p>

            <p>§ 10-1-10. Disposition of goods repossessed after default; right to recover deficiency
When any goods have been repossessed after default in accordance with Part 6 of Article 9 of Title 11, the seller or holder shall not be entitled to recover a deficiency against the buyer unless within ten days after said repossession he forwards by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the address of the buyer shown on the contract or later designated by the buyer a notice of the seller's or holder's intention to pursue a deficiency claim against the buyer. The notice shall also advise the buyer of his rights of redemption, as well as his right to demand a public sale of the repossessed goods. In the event the buyer exercises his right to demand a public sale of the goods, he shall in writing so advise the seller or holder of his election by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery addressed to the seller or holder at the address from which the seller's or holder's notice emanated, within ten days after the posting of the original seller's or holder's notice.
In the event of election of such public sale by the buyer, the seller or holder shall dispose of the repossessed goods at a public sale as provided by law, to be held in the state and county where the original sale took place or the state and county of the buyer's residence, at the seller's election.

This Code section is cumulative of Part 6 of Article 9 of Title 11 and provides cumulative additional rights and remedies which must be fulfilled before any deficiency claim will lie against a buyer, and nothing in this Code section shall be deemed to repeal said part.

            <p>§ 10-1-34. Right to prepay debt; credit upon anticipation of payments
Notwithstanding the provisions of any retail installment contract to the contrary, any buyer may pay in full at any time before maturity the debt of any retail installment contract and, in so paying the debt, shall receive a refund credit thereon for the anticipation of payments. The amount of the refund shall represent at least as great a proportion of the finance charge as the sum of the monthly time balance after the month in which prepayment is made bears to the sum of all the monthly time balances under the schedule of payments in the contract. This method of refund upon prepayment is commonly referred to as the "Rule of 78" or the "Sum of the Digits" refund method. Where the amount of credit is less than $1.00, no refund need be made. This Code section shall not apply to credit upon anticipation of payments or upon acceleration in those cases where the seller or holder of the contract has computed finance charges according to the actuarial method as set forth in Code Section 10-1-33.

            <p>§ 10-1-51. Unordered merchandise sent after membership terminated deemed gift; enjoining payment requests
If a person is a member of an organization which makes retail sales of any goods, wares, or merchandise to its members and the person notifies the organization of his termination of membership by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, any unordered goods, wares, or merchandise which are sent to the person after 30 days following execution of the return receipt for the certified letter by the organization shall for all purposes be deemed unconditional gifts to the person, who may use or dispose of the goods, wares, or merchandise in any manner he sees fit without any obligation on his part to the organization.
If the termination of a person's membership in such organization breaches any agreement with the organization, nothing in this Code section shall relieve the person from liability for damages to which he might be otherwise subjected to pursuant to law; but he shall not be subject to any damages with respect to any goods, wares, or merchandise which are deemed unconditional gifts to him under this Code section.

If, after any receipt deemed to be an unconditional gift under this Code section, the sender continues to send bill statements or requests for payment with respect thereto, an action may be brought by the recipient to enjoin such conduct, in which action there may also be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing party.

          <content>
            <p>§ 10-1-233. Acts of distributor violating articleIt shall be a violation of this article for any gasoline distributor who has a marketing agreement with a gasoline dealer, directly or indirectly, through any officer, agent, or employee, to commit any of the following acts:
(1)  To terminate or cancel such marketing agreement without good cause prior to the expiration date;

(2)  To terminate or cancel an existing marketing agreement prior to this expiration date or to fail to enter into subsequent agreements without having first given written notice setting forth all the reasons for such action to the gasoline dealer at least 60 days in advance of such termination, cancellation, or expiration of the existing agreement; provided, however, that such notice shall not be required of a gasoline distributor acting with reasonable cause to believe the dealer is maliciously and willfully damaging the property rights of the gasoline distributor or if the dealer has voluntarily abandoned the marketing relationship or after five days' notice has failed to pay his just debts when due to the distributor;

(3)  By the use of coercion, intimidation, or threats, to force or induce such gasoline dealer to deal exclusively in products manufactured, distributed, or sponsored by the gasoline distributor or to participate in promotions. Hours of operation which are set in any written agreement in effect prior to July 1, 1978, can only be changed by mutual consent. It shall also be the duty of the distributor to advise the dealer in writing prior to execution of the agreement the projected potential gallonage and the dealer shall acknowledge same in writing prior to execution of the marketing agreement that he is willing to accept same;

(4)  To engage in any acts which have the purpose, intent, or effect of fixing or maintaining prices or of forcing or inducing adherence to prices at which such gasoline distributor's products are to be resold by such gasoline dealers, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit recommendation, suggestion, urging, or discussion;

(5)  To require a gasoline dealer, at the time of entering into a marketing agreement, to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this article;

(6)  To require or prohibit any change in management of any gasoline dealer unless such requirement or prohibition of change shall be for good cause, which cause shall be stated in writing by the gasoline distributor;

(7)  To impose standards of performance upon the gasoline dealer other than those in the marketing agreement;

(8)  To provide any term or condition in any marketing agreement, or other agreement ancillary or collateral thereto, which term or condition directly or indirectly violates this article;

(9)  After July 1, 1978, to require operation in excess of a six-day week or in excess of a 12 hour day if the dealer can prove it results in substantially lessening the profits earned in his entire operation to the extent that it is not economically feasible to continue said operation; provided, however, that this paragraph shall in no way impair the obligation of contracts made prior to July 1, 1978; and provided, further, that this paragraph shall not impair the writing of a contract for hours in excess of the hours expressed in this paragraph or impair the right to enforce the hours contained in any contract until sufficient evidence is available to a dealer to exercise the rights provided in this article; and provided, further, that this paragraph shall not be applicable to dealers or distributors who operate a food or convenience store in conjunction with the retail sale of automotive gasoline and related products.

            <p>§ 10-1-234. Selling controlled product to another distributor for retail sale; selling to other dealers at distress prices
It shall be an unlawful predatory and unfair business practice for an automotive gasoline distributor who controls a product supply, controls the price of that product and has the power to require the purchase of that product by another automotive gasoline distributor or an automotive gasoline dealer doing business in this state to sell said product at prevailing automotive gasoline distributor prices at any time to another automotive gasoline distributor for resale to automotive gasoline dealers with the purpose or intent that said product will be sold at retail by said automotive gasoline distributor and fails to offer its automotive gasoline dealers an opportunity to purchase an equal volume of product upon the same terms and conditions, excepting expenses for advertising, credit cards, and other expenses relative to its automotive gasoline dealers, when said automotive gasoline distributor is selling said product at distress prices to other automotive gasoline dealers in the dealer's marketing area. As used in this Code section, the term "distress prices" shall not be construed to include or embrace a price established for the purpose of meeting competition.

            <p>§ 10-1-234.1. Suppliers may not inhibit gasoline distributors from being blenders
Regardless of other products offered, any supplier which, pursuant to a marketing agreement, supplies gasoline from a terminal in this state to a gasoline distributor shall offer to supply such party with gasoline that has not been blended with, but is suitable for blending with, fuel alcohol. No supplier shall prevent or inhibit a gasoline distributor in this state from being a blender or from qualifying for any federal or state tax credit due to blenders. If a supplier supplies gasoline to a gasoline distributor pursuant to this Code section which is then blended, the gasoline distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless such supplier against any losses or damages arising out of claims, costs, judgments, and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, or suits relating to or arising out of such blending.

No franchisor, nor any agent nor employee of a franchisor, shall use a written instrument, agreement, or waiver to attempt to nullify any of the provisions of this article and any such agreement, written instrument, or waiver shall be null and void. This Code section shall not prevent a dealer from voluntarily entering into a valid release agreement to resolve a specific claim, dispute, or action between the franchisor and the dealer or when separate and adequate consideration is offered and accepted, provided that the renewal of a franchise shall not by itself constitute separate and adequate consideration.

            <p>§ 10-1-675. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds and declares that the distribution of marine vessels and products in the State of Georgia vitally affects the general economy of the state and the public interest and public welfare and, in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate marine manufacturers, distributors, and dealers and their representatives doing business in Georgia in order to prevent unfair business practices, unfair methods of competition, impositions, and other abuses upon its citizens.

(A)  Has made a material misrepresentation in applying for or acting under the franchise agreement;

(B)  Has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against the dealer which has not been discharged within 30 days after the filing, is in default under the provisions of a security agreement in effect with the manufacturer or distributor, or is in receivership;

            <p>§ 10-1-679.8. Sale or transfer of ownership or change in management of dealerships; unlawful practices; required notices
It shall be unlawful for any grantor to prevent or refuse to approve the sale or transfer of the ownership of a recreational vehicle dealership by the sale of the business assets, stock transfer, or otherwise, or a change in executive management or principal operator of the dealership if the new owner, principal operator, or management is creditworthy, has not been convicted of a felony, and is properly licensed; the sale or transfer shall not result in a relocation of the business; and the sale or transfer is otherwise reasonable under the circumstances. The recreational vehicle dealer must give the manufacturer 30 days' written notice prior to the closing of such agreement. If the manufacturer rejects a proposed change or sale, the manufacturer shall give written notice of its reasons to the recreational vehicle dealer within 30 days after receipt of the dealer notification and complete documentation. If no such notice is given to the recreational vehicle dealer, the change or sale shall be deemed approved. The burden of proving that any sale or transfer is not reasonable shall be on the grantor.

              <p>It shall be unlawful for any grantor to fail to provide a recreational vehicle dealer with an opportunity, at the time of signing a recreational vehicle dealership franchise agreement or at a reasonable time thereafter, to designate a member of his or her family as a successor to the dealership in the event of the death, incapacity, or retirement of the dealer. A dealer may from time to time during the term of the franchise agreement change the beneficiary by providing a written notification to the manufacturer.</p>

              <p>Grounds for objection shall be lack of creditworthiness, conviction of a felony, inability to obtain necessary and required licenses by the beneficiary, lack of required licenses, or other conditions which make such succession unreasonable under the circumstances, but the grantor shall bear the burden of proving the unreasonableness of such succession. No family member of the deceased, incapacitated, or retired dealer may succeed to a recreational vehicle dealership unless the succession to the recreational vehicle dealership will not involve, without the grantor's consent, a relocation of the business.

              <p>A dealer shall have the right, effective upon his death or retirement, to have the producer or redistributor offer a trial franchise to the designated family member who has been approved by the producer or redistributor in accordance with the producer's or redistributor's reasonable standard for personal and financial condition unless the producer or redistributor shows that the designated family member no longer meets the reasonable standards set at the time of designation of the previous approval. The foregoing shall not prohibit a producer or redistributor from requiring that the designated family member accept the trial franchise within 30 days of the dealer's death or retirement and that the designated family member attend a training program offered by the producer or redistributor. As used in this Code section, the term "trial franchise" shall have the same meaning as provided in the federal Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (15 U.S.C. Section 2801, et seq.).</p>

The provisions of this article shall be deemed to be incorporated into every agreement subject to this article and shall supersede and control all other provisions of any agreement inconsistent with this article.  No supplier shall require any multiline dealer to waive compliance with any provision of this article.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit or prohibit good faith settlements of disputes voluntarily entered into between the parties.

Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss.  If neither damages nor unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation are proved by a preponderance of the evidence, the court may award damages caused by misappropriation measured in terms of a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited.</p>

In an action under this article, a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means, which may include granting protective orders in connection with discovery proceedings, holding in camera hearings, sealing the records of the action, and ordering any person involved in the litigation not to disclose an alleged trade secret without prior court approval.

An action for misappropriation must be brought within five years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered. For the purposes of this Code section, a continuing misappropriation by any person constitutes a single claim against that person, but this Code section shall be applied separately to the claim against each person who receives a trade secret from another person who misappropriated that trade secret.

            <p>§ 10-1-772. Protective order; posting; waiver of bond
If proceedings are initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction by the author of a demand letter or the author's agent, principal, client, or employee, a target may move that a bad faith assertion of patent infringement has been made in violation of this article and request that a protective order be issued as described in this Code section. Upon such motion and a finding by the court that a target has established a reasonable likelihood that an author of a demand letter has made a bad faith assertion of patent infringement, the court shall require the author of the demand letter to post a bond in an amount equal to a good faith estimate of the target's expenses of litigation, including an estimate of reasonable attorney's fees, conditioned upon payment of any amounts finally determined to be due to the target. A hearing shall be held if either party so requests. A bond ordered pursuant to this Code section shall not exceed $250,000.00. The court may waive the bond requirement if it finds the author of the demand letter has available assets equal to the amount of the proposed bond or for other good cause shown.

            <p>§ 10-1-781. Legislative intent
The General Assembly recognizes that a new motor vehicle is a major consumer purchase and that a defectively manufactured new motor vehicle is likely to create hardship for, or may cause injury to, the consumer. It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a procedure for expeditious resolution of complaints and disputes concerning nonconforming new motor vehicles, to provide a method for notifying consumers of their rights under this article, and to ensure that consumers receive information, documents, and service necessary to enable them to exercise their rights under this article. In enacting these comprehensive measures, the General Assembly intends to encourage manufacturers to take all steps necessary to correct nonconformities in new motor vehicles and to create the proper blend of private and public remedies necessary to enforce this article.

                <p>If a consumer reports a nonconformity during the lemon law rights period, the manufacturer, its authorized agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer shall be allowed a reasonable number of attempts to repair and correct the nonconformity. A reasonable number of attempts shall be deemed to have been undertaken by the manufacturer, its authorized agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer if, during the lemon law rights period:
(A)  A serious safety defect has been subject to repair one time and the serious safety defect has not been corrected;

(B)  The same nonconformity has been subject to repair three times and the nonconformity has not been corrected; or(C)  The vehicle is out of service by reason of repair of one or more nonconformities for a cumulative total of 30 days.
      If the vehicle is being repaired by the manufacturer through an authorized agent or a new motor vehicle dealer on the date that the lemon law rights period expires, the lemon law rights period shall be extended until that repair attempt has been completed.</p>

                <p>(A) If the manufacturer through an authorized agent or a new motor vehicle dealer is unable to repair and correct a nonconformity after a reasonable number of attempts, the consumer shall notify the manufacturer by statutory overnight delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested, of the need to repair and correct the nonconformity. The notice shall be sent to the address provided by the manufacturer in the owner's manual. The manufacturer shall have 28 days from its receipt of the notice to make a final attempt to repair and correct the nonconformity.
(B)  By not later than the close of business on the seventh day following receipt of notice from the consumer, the manufacturer shall notify the consumer of the location of a repair facility that is reasonably accessible to the consumer. By not later than the close of business on the fourteenth day following the manufacturer's receipt of notice, the consumer shall deliver the nonconforming new motor vehicle to the designated repair facility.

(C)  If the manufacturer fails to notify the consumer of the location of a reasonably accessible repair facility within seven days of its receipt of notice, or fails to complete the final attempt to repair and correct the nonconformity within the 28 day time period, the requirement that it be given a final attempt to repair and correct the nonconformity shall not apply. However, if the consumer delivers the nonconforming new motor vehicle to the designated repair facility more than 14 days from the date the manufacturer receives notice from the consumer, the 28 day time period shall be extended and the manufacturer shall have 14 days from the date the nonconforming new motor vehicle is delivered to the repair facility to complete the final attempt to repair and correct the nonconformity.</p>

The manufacturer shall pay to the lessor an amount equal to 110 percent of the adjusted capitalized cost of the nonconforming new motor vehicle. After the lessor has received payment from the manufacturer as specified in this subparagraph and payment from the consumer of all past due charges, if any, the consumer shall have no further obligation to the lessor.
(B)  If a consumer who is not a lessee elects a repurchase, the manufacturer shall pay to the consumer an amount equal to the purchase price of the nonconforming new motor vehicle plus all collateral charges and incidental costs, less a reasonable offset for use of the nonconforming new motor vehicle. Payment shall be made to the consumer and lienholder of record, if any, as their interests may appear on the records of ownership.

              <p>A manufacturer which does not appeal a decision in favor of a consumer must fully comply with the decision within 40 days of entry thereof. If a manufacturer does not fully comply within the 40 day time period, the Attorney General may issue an order imposing a civil penalty of up to $1,000.00 per day for each day that the manufacturer remains out of compliance. The provisions of Code Sections 10-1-398 and 10-1-398.1 shall apply in connection with the imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection. It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection that a delay or failure to comply was beyond the manufacturer's control or that a delay was acceptable to the consumer.

(4)  "Manufacturer's express warranty" or "warranty" means the written warranty of the manufacturer of a new farm tractor of its condition and fitness for use, including any terms or conditions precedent to the enforcement of obligations under that warranty.

(5)  "Nonconformity" means any condition of the farm tractor that makes it impossible to use for the purpose for which it was designed or manufactured.

(6)  "Reasonable allowance for prior use" means the number of field hours performed by the farm equipment, divided by eight field hours per day, multiplied by 50 percent of the daily reasonable rental rate, referenced by model, in the most current North American Equipment Dealers Association Official Guide.

(D)  No disputes shall be heard where there has been a recent attempt by the manufacturer to repair a consumer's farm tractor, but no response has yet been received by the informal dispute panel from the consumer as to whether the repairs were successfully completed.  This provision shall not prejudice a consumer's rights under this Code section nor shall it extend the informal dispute panel's 40 day time limit for deciding disputes, as established by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 16, Part 703; and(E)  The manufacturer shall provide and the informal dispute settlement panel shall consider all information relevant to resolving the dispute, such as the prior dispute records and information required by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 16, Part 703.6, and any relevant technical service bulletins which may have been issued by the manufacturer or lessor regarding the farm tractor being disputed.</p>

            <p>§ 10-1-872. Express written warranties for assistive technology devices
A manufacturer who sells an assistive technology device to a consumer, either directly or through an assistive technology device dealer, shall furnish the consumer with an express written warranty for the assistive technology device.  The warranty shall as a minimum warrant that there are no defects in parts or performance.  The duration of the express written warranty shall be not less than one year after first delivery of the assistive technology device to the consumer. If a manufacturer fails to furnish an express written warranty as required by this Code section, the assistive technology device shall be covered by an express warranty as if the manufacturer had furnished an express written warranty to the consumer as required by this Code section.

If in any subsequent proceeding it is determined that the consumer's repair did not qualify under this article, and the manufacturer was not otherwise obligated to repair the assistive technology device, the consumer shall be liable to the manufacturer for costs of repair.</p>

            <p>§ 10-1-892. Express written warranties for motorized wheelchairs; failure to furnish warranty
A manufacturer who sells a motorized wheelchair to a consumer, either directly or through a motorized wheelchair dealer, shall furnish the consumer with an express written warranty for the motorized wheelchair warranting parts and performance.  The duration of the express written warranty shall be not less than one year after first delivery of the motorized wheelchair to the consumer.  If a manufacturer fails to furnish an express written warranty as required by this Code section, the motorized wheelchair shall be covered by an express warranty as if the manufacturer had furnished an express written warranty to the consumer as required by this Code section.

            <p>§ 10-1-910. Legislative findingsThe General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
(1)  The privacy and financial security of individuals is increasingly at risk due to the ever more widespread collection of personal information by both the private and public sectors;

(2)  Credit card transactions, magazine subscriptions, real estate records, automobile registrations, consumer surveys, warranty registrations, credit reports, and Internet websites are all sources of personal information and form the source material for identity thieves;

(3)  Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes committed in this state. Criminals who steal personal information such as social security numbers use the information to open credit card accounts, write bad checks, buy cars, purchase property, and commit other financial crimes with other people's identities;

(4)  Implementation of technology security plans and security software as part of an information security policy may provide protection to consumers and the general public from identity thieves;

(5)  Information brokers should clearly define the standards for authorized users of its data so that a breach by an unauthorized user is easily identifiable;

(6)  Identity theft is costly to the marketplace and to consumers; and

(7)  Victims of identity theft must act quickly to minimize the damage; therefore, expeditious notification of unauthorized acquisition and possible misuse of a person's personal information is imperative.

              <p>of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the consumer shall also be provided with the following notice:"Georgia Consumers Have the Right to Obtain a Security Freeze. 
You have a right to place a 'security freeze' on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. A security freeze must be requested in writing by certified mail or by electronic means as provided by a consumer reporting agency. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. If you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone, or insurance account, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze in advance of actually applying for new credit. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or authorize the release of your credit report for a period of time after the freeze is in place.To provide that authorization you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:</p>

                <p>minutes after receiving the above information if the request is by electronic means or by telephone, or no later than three business days when a written request is submitted.
A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account, that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance. You have a right to bring civil action against anyone, including a consumer reporting agency, who improperly obtains access to a file, knowingly or willfully misuses file data, or fails to correct inaccurate file data. Unless you are a victim of identity theft with a police report or other official document acceptable to a consumer reporting agency to verify the crimes, or you are 65 or older, a consumer reporting agency has the right to charge you a fee of no more than $3.00 to place a freeze on your credit report."

(1)  If the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes or errors and one party has conformed to the procedure but the other party has not, and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party also conformed, the conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or erroneous electronic record;(2)  In an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual:
(A)  Promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person;

(B)  Takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other person's reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the other person, to destroy the consideration received, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record; and

(C)  Has not used or received any benefit or value from the consideration, if any, received from the other person;

(3)  If neither paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) of this Code section applies, the change or error shall have the effect provided by other law, including the law of mistake, and the parties' contract, if any; and

(4)  Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Code section shall not be varied by agreement.

              <p>Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the state and to the citizens of the state. The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.</p>

              <p>On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the "Master Settlement Agreement," with the state. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present, and certain future claims against them as described therein, to pay substantial sums to the state (tied in part to their volume of sales); to fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.</p>

              <p>It would be contrary to the policy of the state if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the state to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.

"Units sold" does not include cigarettes the purchase or use of which the state is prohibited from taxing under the Constitution or statutes of the United States. The state revenue commissioner and the Attorney General may promulgate such regulations as are necessary to ascertain the amount of state excise tax paid on the cigarettes of such tobacco product manufacturer for each year.

              <p>The legislature recognizes that purchasers of preneed burial rights, funeral or burial merchandise, or funeral services or burial services may suffer serious economic harm if purchase money is not set aside for future use as intended by the purchaser and that the failure to maintain cemetery grounds properly may cause significant emotional distress. Therefore, it is necessary in the interest of the public welfare to regulate preneed dealers, licensees, registrants, and cemetery companies in this state. However, restrictions shall be imposed only to the extent necessary to protect the public from significant or discernible harm or damage and not in a manner which will unreasonably affect the competitive market.</p>

If a cemetery existing on July 1, 2000, has an existing perpetual care trust fund which complies with provisions of law in effect on the date of its establishment, a new trust fund created in compliance with this chapter shall not require an initial deposit.</p>

The Secretary of State shall adopt such adjustment to the amount of said minimum deposit by rule. Deposits to the trust fund shall be made not later than 30 days following the last day of the month in which payment therefor is made, or, in the case of a free space, the month in which the space is given. In the event any sale is made on an installment basis, not less than a pro rata share of the principal portion of each payment made and allocated to the lot, grave, space, niche, mausoleum, columbarium, urn, or crypt shall be allocated to the required trust fund deposit, provided that all deposits to the trust fund shall be completed within six years from the date of the signing of the perpetual care contract.

              <p>Where the Secretary of State finds that there are grounds for the prohibition from employment provided in this Code section, he or she may issue an order prohibiting an employee, officer, independent contractor, or other agent directly or indirectly involved in cemetery or preneed sales or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions from employment with a registered cemetery or preneed dealer. Such an order shall not be effective until notice and opportunity for hearing are provided in accordance with Code Section 10-14-23 and until the Secretary of State shall issue a written order in accordance with Code Section 10-14-23; but the Secretary of State may, if he or she finds that the public safety or welfare requires emergency action, immediately issue an order prohibiting such person from such employment. Such an order of immediate prohibition will expire automatically if the Secretary of State fails to afford notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to Code Section 10-14-23.

              <p>Every person intending to engage in business as a warehouseman under this article shall, prior to commencing such business and periodically thereafter as the Commissioner shall require, execute and file with the Commissioner a good and sufficient bond to the state to secure the faithful performance of his or her obligation as a warehouseman under the terms of this article and the rules and regulations prescribed under this article, such bond to be computed in direct ratio to the licensed storage capacity of the warehouse bonded. The bond shall be executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the Commissioner. Such bond shall be upon forms prescribed by the Commissioner. Any and all bond applications shall be accompanied by a certificate of "good standing" issued by the Commissioner of Insurance. If any company issuing a bond shall be removed from doing business in this state, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Insurance to notify the Commissioner of Agriculture within 30 days. The Commissioner shall have authority to fix the bond for any part of licensed storage capacity of the warehouse being used; but in no event shall the amount of the bond be required to exceed 15 percent of the value of the products stored and the bond shall be in such form and amount and shall have such surety or sureties, subject to service of process in actions on the bonds with this state, as the Commissioner may prescribe; provided, however, the minimum bond to be posted for each warehouse shall be $20,000.00 and the maximum bond to be required for each warehouse shall be $300,000.00.</p>

            <p>§ 10-4-21. Obligation of warehouseman to deliver; effect of loss or damageEvery warehouseman conducting a warehouse under this article shall, without unnecessary delay, deliver the agricultural product as described on each warehouse receipt issued by him upon a demand made by the holder of a receipt for such agricultural product if the demand be accompanied by:
(1)  An offer to satisfy the warehouseman's lien;

(2)  An offer to surrender the receipt and, if negotiable, with such endorsements as would be necessary for the negotiation of the receipt; and

(3)  An offer to sign, when the product is delivered, an acknowledgment that it has been delivered if such signature is requested by the warehouseman;

provided, however, that where an agricultural product is stored identity preserved, the actual agricultural product shall be delivered; provided, further, that no warehouseman shall be deemed to have violated this Code section by failure to deliver any agricultural product in accordance with its provisions, if such failure is due to loss or damage of the product from a hazard against which insurance is not required under Code Section 10-4-25 and the regulations issued by the Commissioner pursuant thereto and where such loss or damage does not result from a failure of such warehouseman to exercise that degree of care which an ordinarily prudent person would exercise in the care and protection of his own property; and, provided, further, that in case of an insured loss such demand may be satisfied by payment of the market value of the product lost or damaged.

All agricultural products stored for the producer in their raw or natural state, and cotton in any form stored for the producer, in storage in a warehouse under this article or deposited temporarily in such a warehouse pending storage shall be kept insured at full market value by the warehouseman against loss or damage by fire, lightning, and extended coverage, except that cotton shall be insured against loss or damage by fire and lightning only. Such insurance shall be carried in an insurance company or companies of the warehouseman's choice authorized to do business in this state, and evidence of such insurance coverage in form to be approved by the Commissioner of Insurance shall be filed with the Commissioner of Agriculture. Such insurance shall be provided by, and carried in the name of, the warehouseman; provided, however, that a producer depositing or storing agricultural products who does not wish to have his products insured by the warehouseman may relieve the warehouseman of that duty by notifying the warehouseman in writing that he does not wish his agricultural products insured.

It shall state that, unless the claim is paid, within the time stated in the notice, the personal property will be advertised for public sale to the highest bidder, and will be sold at a public sale to the highest bidder, at a specified time and place.
      After the expiration of the time given in Owner's notice, Owner shall publish an advertisement of the public sale to the highest bidder, once a week, for two consecutive weeks, in the legal organ for the county where the self-service storage facility is located.

                <p>days after the first publication. Regardless of whether a sale involves the property of more than one Occupant, a single advertisement may be used to advertise the disposal of property at the sale. A public sale includes offering the property on a publicly accessible website that regularly conducts online auctions of personal property. Such sale shall be considered incidental to the self-storage business and no license shall be required.
      If no one purchases the property at the public sale and if Owner has complied with the foregoing procedures, Owner may otherwise dispose of the property and shall notify Occupant of the action taken. Any sale or disposition of the personal property shall be held at the self-service storage facility or at the nearest suitable place to where the personal property is held or stored.
      Before any sale or other disposition of personal property pursuant to this agreement, Occupant may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred and thereby redeem the personal property and thereafter Owner shall have no liability to any person with respect to such personal property.
      A Purchaser in good faith of the personal property sold to satisfy Owner's lien takes the property free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid, despite noncompliance by Owner with the requirements of this agreement.
In the event of a sale, Owner may satisfy his or her lien from the proceeds of the sale. Owner shall hold the balance of the proceeds, if any, for Occupant or any notified secured interest holder. If not claimed within two years of the date of sale, the balance of the proceeds shall be disposed of in accordance with Article 5 of Chapter 12 of Title 44, the "Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act." In no event shall Owner's liability exceed the proceeds of the sale.

If the rental agreement contains a limit on the value of property stored in Occupant's storage space, the limit shall be deemed to b</p>

              <p>An individual is not excused from attending, testifying, filing a statement, producing a record or other evidence, or obeying a subpoena of the Commissioner under this chapter or in an action or proceeding instituted by the Commissioner under this chapter on the ground that the required testimony, statement, record, or other evidence, directly or indirectly, may tend to incriminate the individual or subject the individual to a criminal fine, penalty, or forfeiture. If the individual refuses to testify, file a statement, or produce a record or other evidence on the basis of the individual's privilege against self-incrimination, the Commissioner may apply to superior court to compel the testimony, the filing of the statement, the production of the record, or the giving of other evidence. The testimony, record, or other evidence compelled under such an order may not be used, directly or indirectly, against the individual in a criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury or contempt or otherwise failing to comply with the order.</p>

              <p>At the request of the securities administrator of another state or a foreign jurisdiction, the Commissioner may provide assistance if the requesting administrator states that it is conducting an investigation to determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate a law or rule of the other state or foreign jurisdiction relating to securities matters that the requesting administrator regulates or enforces. The Commissioner may provide the assistance by using the authority to investigate and the powers conferred by this Code section as the Commissioner determines is necessary or appropriate. The assistance may be provided without regard to whether the conduct described in the request would also constitute a violation of this chapter or other law of this state if occurring in this state. In deciding whether to provide the assistance, the Commissioner may consider whether the requesting administrator is permitted and has agreed to provide assistance reciprocally within its state or foreign jurisdiction to the Commissioner on securities matters when requested; whether compliance with the request would violate or prejudice the public policy of this state; and the availability of resources and employees of the Commissioner to carry out the request for assistance.</p>

            <p>§ 10-6-2. Formality necessary to create agency
Where the exercise or performance of an agency is by written instrument, the agency shall also be created by written instrument; provided, however, unless a contrary intent is expressly set forth therein, any written instrument creating an agency regardless of the formality of its execution shall conclusively be deemed to authorize the execution of instruments with the formalities necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes for which the agency was granted.  A corporation may create an agent in its usual mode of transacting business and without its corporate seal. Any deed or other instrument executed under seal pursuant to an agency created by an act not under seal, if not otherwise required to be under seal for its validity, shall be binding upon the principal and valid as if an unsealed instrument.

          <content>
            <p>§ 10-6-33. Revocation of agency -- When and how done; damages for unreasonable revocation
Generally, an agency is revocable at the will of the principal. The appointment of a new agent for the performance of the same act or the death of either principal or agent revokes the power. If, however, the power is coupled with an interest in the agent himself, it is not revocable at will. In all cases the agent may recover from the principal, for an unreasonable revocation, any damages he may have suffered by reason thereof.

            <p>§ 10-6-82. Agent's right of action on principal's contractsGenerally, an agent shall have no right of action on contracts made for his principal. The following are exceptions:
(1)  A factor contracting on his own credit;

(2)  Where promissory notes or other evidences of debt are made payable to an agent of a corporation;

(3)  In all cases where the contract is made with the agent in his individual name, though his agency be known;

(4)  Auctioneers may sue in their own names for goods sold by them;

(5)  In cases of agency coupled with an interest in the agent, known to the party contracting with him.

In all these cases, payment to the principal before notice of the agent's claim is a good defense.

Any person, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity which engages in the business of receiving cash from patrons as payment of obligations owed by such patrons to third parties, with the understanding that such person, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity will act as agent of the patron in making payment directly to the third party must, as a condition to engaging in such a business, post a bond as security in the amount of $50,000.00 with the clerk of the superior court in the county in which its principal place of business is located; provided, however, that no such bonding requirement need be met by any person, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity who or which handles or administers fewer than 20 payments per month; provided, further, that no such bonding requirement need be met by any person, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity who or which has received written authorization from a third party to act as agent for the third party. Written authorization to the agent from one or more third parties does not relieve the agent from posting the security bond as required by this Code section if the agent is receiving 20 or more cash payments owed to one or more other third parties from whom no written authorization has been received.

          <content>
            <p>§ 10-7-24. Refusal to sue principal after notice by surety as discharge
Any surety, guarantor, or endorser, at any time after the debt on which he or she is liable becomes due, may give notice in writing to the creditor, his or her agent, or any person having possession or control of the obligation, to proceed to collect the debt from the principal or any one of the several principals liable therefor; and, if the creditor or holder refuses or fails to commence an action for the space of three months after such notice (the principal being within the jurisdiction of this state), the endorser, guarantor, or surety giving the notice, as well as all subsequent endorsers and all cosureties, shall be discharged. To comply with the requirements of this Code section, the notice must specifically state that the creditor loses his or her rights to pursue the surety, guarantor, or endorser, as well as any cosureties, coguarantors, or endorsers, if the creditor does not commence legal action within three months after receiving the notice.  Further, any notice which does not state the county in which the principal resides shall not be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of this Code section.

The amount of such reasonable attorney's fees shall be determined by the trial jury and shall be included in any judgment rendered in such action; provided, however, that such attorney's fees shall be fixed on the basis of competent expert evidence as to the reasonable value of such services, based on the time spent and legal and factual issues involved, in accordance with prevailing fees in the locality where the action is pending; provided, further, that the trial court shall have the discretion, if it finds such jury verdict fixing attorney's fees to be greatly excessive or inadequate, to review and amend such portion of the verdict fixing attorney's fees without the necessity of disapproving the entire verdict.

The authority is authorized and directed to contract with the Department of Economic Development to exercise on behalf of the department such future responsibility in connection with the acquisition, construction, operation, management, and maintenance of the project as is now or may be vested in the department; and the Department of Economic Development is authorized by such contract to delegate to the authority all of its responsibilities and powers with respect to the project and to transfer to the authority any and all contracts, plans, documents, or other papers of said department relating to the project, together with any and all funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated to it for the acquisition, construction, operation, management, or maintenance of the project or for all other purposes related to the project, other than appropriations made specifically for debt service purposes, as compensation to the authority under such contract. Under contract with the Department of Economic Development, as herein authorized, the authority on behalf of the Department of Economic Development shall plan, construct, erect, acquire, own, repair, remodel, maintain, add to, extend, improve, equip, operate, and manage the project, as hereinabove defined, on property owned by or leased by the State of Georgia in the City of Atlanta, Georgia, the cost of any such project to be paid in full or in part from the proceeds of general obligation bonds issued by the State of Georgia as the General Assembly may authorize or from such proceeds and other funds as may be available for such purposes, including any grant from the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof. All actions of the authority and the Department of Economic Development, or their predecessors, heretofore taken in connection with such contractual relationship, are ratified and confirmed and shall not be affected by any provision of this chapter. Nothing herein shall affect the powers or duties of the Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission or of the State Properties Commission. Nothing in this Code section nor anything in any contract between the authority and the Department of Economic Development shall prevent the Department of Economic Development from contracting with the Georgia Building Authority for the provision of a parking facility or for any other exercise of its powers necessary or convenient to the department.

The exemption from taxation provided for in this Code section shall include an exemption from sales and use tax on tangible personal property purchased by the authority for use exclusively by the authority. The revenue bonds or other evidence of indebtedness issued by the authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within this state by the state or its municipalities or political subdivisions.

            <p>§ 10-9-12. Acceptance of grants, contributions, and gifts of money, property, or services
The authority, in addition to the moneys received from the collection of revenues, rents, and earnings derived under the provisions of this chapter or from the Department of Economic Development, shall have authority to accept from any entity or agency of the United States, of this state, or of any county, municipality, political subdivision, or public authority and from any private individual or entity, grants, contributions, or gifts of either money or property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, or services or other things of value, in the furtherance of the purposes and powers of the authority. Incident to the acceptance of any such grant, contribution, or gift, the authority may accept and bind itself to express terms and conditions imposed incident to the grant, contribution, or gift governing the use and application of the money or property or the use of disposition of any property acquired therewith, provided that such term or condition is expressly accepted by the authority, is consistent with the purposes and powers of the authority under this chapter, and is not inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of this state. Any such term or condition may require the authority to hold any money or property in trust separate from other money or property of the authority and any such money or property so held shall not be subject to any claims against or liability of the authority not arising from the use or application of the money or property so held or the operation of the property so held or acquired therewith.

The resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds may provide that the proceeds thereof shall be disbursed upon requisition or order of the chairman of the authority or other designated officer of the authority or by the Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission acting on behalf of the authority under contract with the authority under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or the trust indenture may provide. If the proceeds of the revenue bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the facility or combined facilities, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, additional revenue bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the revenue bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the revenue bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such revenue bonds are issued, the surplus shall be used for one or more of the following purposes:
(1)  Payment into the fund provided in Code Section 10-9-51 for the payment of principal and interest of such revenue bonds; or

(2)  For the purchase of such revenue bonds in the open market.

            <p>§ 10-9-52. Enforcement of rights by bondholder, receiver, or indenture trustee
Any holder of revenue bonds or interest coupons thereon issued under this article, any receiver for such holders, or any indenture trustee, if there is any, except to the extent the rights given in this article may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted under this article or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this article or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof. In the event of default upon the principal and interest or other obligations of any revenue bond issue, any such holder, receiver, or indenture trustee shall be subrogated to each and every right of collecting rentals, revenues, earnings, or funds by the authority which the authority may possess under contracts designated as security therefor, and, in the pursuit of its remedies as subrogee, may proceed either at law or in equity by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceeding due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged to the benefit of the revenue bond issue. No individual, receiver, or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such revenue bond or the interest thereon or otherwise to enforce the payment thereof against the state or the authority or any property of the state or authority, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state or authority except the rents, revenues, earnings, and funds designated as security for the revenue bonds. In addition to the foregoing, the resolution or trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders subject to the limitations otherwise stated in this article. All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of the project affected by the indenture.
