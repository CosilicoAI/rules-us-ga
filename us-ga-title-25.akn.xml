          <content>
            <p>§ 25-11-2. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Certificate" or "certificate of competency" means the document issued by the Commissioner to a certificate holder who has demonstrated adequate technical knowledge and ability to design in accordance with recognized standards as adopted by the Commissioner and to perform and supervise the installation, repair, alteration, addition, maintenance, or inspection of water-based fire protection systems.

(2)  "Certificate holder" means an individual who has been issued a certificate of competency by the Commissioner.

(3)  "Commissioner" means the Georgia Safety Fire Commissioner.

(4)  "Fire protection sprinkler contractor" means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or joint venture that supervises, performs, or supervises and performs the installation, repair, alteration, addition, maintenance, or inspection of water-based fire protection systems. Such term does not include local building officials, fire inspectors, or insurance inspectors when acting in their official capacities.

(5)  "Fire protection sprinkler contractor license" means the document issued by the Commissioner to the fire protection sprinkler contractor which authorizes the fire protection sprinkler contractor to engage in the business of fabrication, installation, repair, alteration, maintenance, or inspection of water-based fire protection systems.

(6)  "Fire protection sprinkler system" means an integrated system of overhead and underground piping designed in accordance with fire protection engineering standards. The installation includes one or more automatic water supplies. The portion of the system aboveground is a network of specially sized or hydraulically designed piping installed in a building, structure, or area, generally overhead, to which sprinklers are attached in a systematic pattern. The valve controlling each system riser is located in the system riser or its supply piping. The system is usually activated by heat from a fire and discharges water over the fire area.

(7)  "Fire protection system designer" means a person who develops documents pertaining to water-based fire protection systems.

(8)  "Fire protection system designer license" means a document issued by the Commissioner which authorizes the fire protection system designer to engage in the business of producing construction shop drawings pertaining to water-based fire protection systems.

(9)  "Fire protection system inspector" means an individual who performs inspections only on water-based fire protection systems in accordance with applicable codes and standards as adopted by the Commissioner. Such term does not apply to state, local, and insurance inspectors while acting in their official capacities.

(10)  "Fire protection system inspector's license" means a document issued by the Commissioner which authorizes the fire protection system inspector to engage in the business of inspecting water-based fire protection systems.

(11)  "Fire pump" means a pump supplying water at the flow and pressure required by water-based fire protection systems.

(12)  "Foam-water spray system" means a special system pipe connected to a source of foam concentrate and to a water supply and equipped with foam-water spray nozzles for fire protection agent discharge (foam and water sequentially in that order or in reverse order) and distribution over the area to be protected. System operation arrangements parallel those for foam-water sprinkler systems.

(13)  "Foam-water sprinkler system" means a special system pipe connected to a source of foam concentrates and to a water supply and equipped with appropriate discharge devices for fire protection agent discharge and distribution over the area to be protected. The piping system is connected to the water supply through a control valve that is usually actuated by operation of automatic detection equipment installed in the same area as the sprinklers. When this valve opens, water flows into the piping system, and foam concentrate is injected into the water. The resulting foam solution discharging through the discharge devices generates and distributes foam. Upon exhaustion of the foam concentrate supply, water discharge will follow the foam and continue until manually shut off. Existing deluge sprinkler systems that have been converted to the use of aqueous film forming foam are classified as foam-water sprinkler systems.

(14)  "Inspection" means a visual examination of a water-based fire protection system or portion thereof to verify that it appears to be in operating condition and is free of physical damage.

(15)  "Maintenance" means work performed to keep equipment operable or to make repairs without altering the operation of the water-based system.(16)  "Private fire service main" means that pipe and its appurtenances on private property that are:
(A)  Between a source of water and the base of the system riser for water-based fire protection systems;

          <content>
            <p>§ 25-12-2. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Commissioner" means the Safety Fire Commissioner.

(2)  "Engineered fire suppression system" means any fire suppression system having pipe lengths, number of fittings, number and types of nozzles, suppression agent flow rates, and nozzle pressures as determined by calculations derived from the appropriate standards of the National Fire Protection Association, whether those calculations are performed by hand or by a computer program or by other method of calculation. These systems may consist of other components, including, but not limited to, detection devices, alarm devices, and control devices as tested and approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory and shall be manufacturer listed as compatible with the fire suppression system involved.

(3)  "Fire suppression system" means any fire-fighting system employing a suppression agent with the purpose of controlling, suppressing, or extinguishing a fire in a specific hazard. The suppression agent shall be a currently recognized agent or water additive required to control, suppress, or extinguish a fire.  The term fire suppression system shall include engineered and preengineered systems as defined in this chapter and shall not include those systems addressed in Chapter 11 of this title.

(4)  "Firm" means any business, person, partnership, organization, association, corporation, contractor, subcontractor, or individual.

(5)  "License" means the document issued by the Commissioner which authorizes a firm to engage in the business of installation, repair, alteration, recharging, inspection, maintenance, service, or testing of fire suppression systems or portable fire extinguishers.

(6)  "Permit" means the document issued by the Commissioner which authorizes an individual to install, inspect, repair, recharge, service, or test fire suppression systems or portable fire extinguishers.

(7)  "Portable fire extinguisher" means a portable device containing an extinguishing agent that can be expelled under pressure for the purpose of suppressing or extinguishing a fire.  The device must be listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.  The device must bear a manufacturer's name and serial number.  The listings, approvals, and serial numbers may be stamped on the manufacturer's identification and instruction plate or on a separate plate of the testing laboratory soldered or attached to the extinguisher shell in a permanent manner set forth by the listing or approving organization.

(8)  "Preengineered fire suppression system" means any system having predetermined flow rates, nozzle pressures, and quantities of an extinguishing agent.  These systems have the specific pipe size, maximum and minimum pipe lengths, flexible hose specifications, number of fittings, and number and types of nozzles prescribed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.  The hazards protected by these systems are specifically limited as to the type and size by the testing laboratory based upon actual fire tests.  Limitations on hazards that can be protected by these systems are contained in the manufacturer's installation manual, which is referenced as part of the listing.

An order of suspension shall state the period of time of such suspension, which period may not be in excess of two years from the date of such order. An order of revocation shall state the period of time of such revocation, which period may not be in excess of five years from the date of such order. Such order shall effect suspension or revocation of all licenses and permits then held by the person, and during such period of time no license or permit shall be issued to such person. During the suspension or revocation of any license or permit, the licensee or permittee whose license or permit has been suspended or revoked shall not engage in or attempt or profess to engage in any transaction or business for which a license or permit is required under this chapter or directly or indirectly own, control, or be employed in any manner by any firm, business, or corporation for which a license or permit under this chapter is required. If, during the period between the beginning of proceedings and the entry of an order of suspension or revocation by the Commissioner, a new license or permit has been issued to the person so charged, the order of suspension or revocation shall operate to suspend or revoke, as the case may be, such new license or permit held by such person.</p>

            <p>§ 25-13-2. Declaration of public policy
It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any municipal, county, or volunteer fire department or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the municipal, county, or volunteer fire department or a member thereof. Furthermore, the municipal, county, or volunteer fire department, which provides quality fire protection and safety services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the department, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any municipal, county, or volunteer fire department's name or any term used to identify the department or its members without the expressed permission of the local governing body. The provisions of this chapter are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.

            <p>§ 25-2-4. Safety Fire Commissioner -- Adoption of rules and regulations
The Commissioner shall adopt such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to promote the enforcement of this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall have the force and effect of law and shall have state-wide application as being the state minimum fire safety standards and shall not require adoption by a municipality or county. The governing authority of any municipality or county in this state is authorized to enforce the state minimum fire safety standards on all buildings and structures except one-family and two-family dwellings and those buildings and structures listed in Code Section 25-2-13.  All other applications of the state minimum fire safety standards and fees are specified in Code Sections 25-2-4.1, 25-2-12, and 25-2-12.1.  Before the Commissioner shall adopt as a part of his rules and regulations for the enforcement of this chapter any of the principles of the various codes referred to in this chapter, he shall first consider and approve them as reasonably suitable for the enforcement of this chapter. Not less than 15 days before any rules and regulations are promulgated, a public hearing shall be held. Notice of the hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation.

              <p>of this Code section or by local county or municipal ordinance, shall have the option of retaining, at its own expense, a private professional provider to provide the required plan review. As used in this paragraph, the term "private professional provider" means a professional engineer who holds a certificate of registration issued under Chapter 15 of Title 43 or a professional architect who holds a certificate of registration issued under Chapter 4 of Title 43, who is not an employee of or otherwise affiliated with or financially interested in the person, firm, or corporation engaged in the construction project to be reviewed.
(B)  The state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official shall advise the permit applicant at the time the complete submittal application for a permit in accordance with the code official's plan submittal process is received that the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official intends to complete the required plan review within the time prescribed by this paragraph or that the applicant may immediately secure the services of a private professional provider to complete the required plan review pursuant to this subsection. The plan submittal process shall include those procedures and approvals required by the local jurisdiction before plan review can take place. If the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official states its intent to complete the required plan review within the time prescribed by this paragraph, the applicant shall not be authorized to use the services of a private professional provider as provided in this subsection. The permit applicant and the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official may agree by mutual consent to extend the time period prescribed by this paragraph for plan review if the characteristics of the project warr</p>

              <p>of this subsection.

(C)  Any plan review or inspection conducted by a private professional provider shall be no less extensive than plan reviews or inspections conducted by state, county, or municipal personnel responsible for review of plans for compliance with the state's minimum fire safety standards and, where applicable, the state's minimum accessibility standards.

(D)  The person, firm, or corporation retaining a private professional provider to conduct a plan review shall be required to pay to the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official which requires the plan review the same regulatory fees and charges which would have been required had the plan review been conducted by the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official.(E)  A private professional provider performing plan reviews under this subsection shall review construction plans to determine compliance with the state's minimum fire safety standards in effect which were adopted pursuant to this chapter and, where applicable, the state's minimum accessibility standards adopted pursuant to Chapter 3 of Title 30. Upon determining that the plans reviewed comply with the applicable codes and standards as adopted, such private professional provider shall prepare an affidavit or affidavits on a form prescribed by the Safety Fire Commissioner certifying under oath that the following is true and correct to the best of such private professional provider's knowledge and belief and in accordance with the applicable professional standard of care:</p>

              <p>The plans were reviewed by the affiant who is duly authorized to perform plan review pursuant to this subsection and who holds the appropriate license or certifications and insurance coverage and insurance coverage stipulated in this subsection; and

(ii)  The plans comply with the state's minimum fire safety standards in effect which were adopted pursuant to this chapter and, where applicable, the state's minimum accessibility standards adopted pursuant to Chapter 3 of Title 30.

(F)  All private professional providers providing plan review services pursuant to this subsection shall secure and maintain insurance coverage for professional liability (errors and omissions) insurance. The limits of such insurance shall be not less than $1 million per claim and $1 million in aggregate coverage. Such insurance may be a practice policy or project-specific coverage. If the insurance is a practice policy, it shall contain prior acts coverage for the private professional provider. If the insurance is project-specific, it shall continue in effect for two years following the issuance of the certificate of final completion for the project. The state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official may establish, for private professional providers working within their respective jurisdictions specified by this chapter, a system of registration listing the private professional providers within their areas of competency and verifying compliance with the insurance requirements of this subsection.

(G)  The private professional provider shall be empowered to perform any plan review required by the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official, regardless if the plan review is required by this subsection or by local county or municipal ordinance, provided that the plan review is within the scope of such private professional provider's area of expertise and competency.

              <p>The permit applicant shall submit a copy of the private professional provider's plan review report to the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official. Such plan review report shall include at a minimum all of the following:
(I)  The affidavit of the private professional provider required pursuant to this subsection;

(II)  The applicable fees required for permitting;

(III)  Other documents deemed necessary due to unusual construction or design, smoke removal systems where applicable with engineering analysis, and additional documentation required where performance based code options are used; and(IV)  Any documents required by the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official to determine that the permit applicant has secured all other governmental approvals required by law.
(ii)  No more than 30 business days after receipt of a permit application and the private professional provider's plan review report required pursuant to this subsection, the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official shall issue the requested permit or provide written notice to the permit applicant identifying the specific plan features that do not comply with the applicable codes or standards, as well as the specific reference to the relevant requirements. If the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official does not provide a written notice of the plan deficiencies within the prescribed 30 day period, the permit application shall be deemed approved as a matter of law and the permit shall be issued by the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official on the next business day.

For all revisions submitted after the first revision, the state fire marshal, the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official shall have an additional five business days to issue the requested permit or to provide a written notice to the permit applicant stating which of the previously identified plan features remain in noncompliance with the applicable codes or standards, with specific reference to the relevant requirements.

(I)  The state fire marshal may provide for the prequalification of private professional providers who may perform plan reviews pursuant to this subsection by rule or regulation authorized in Code Section 25-2-4. In addition, any local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official may provide for the prequalification of private professional providers who may perform plan reviews pursuant to this subsection; however, no additional local ordinance implementing prequalification shall become effective until notice of the proper local fire marshal, state inspector, or designated code official's intent to require prequalification and the specific requirements for prequalification have been advertised in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements for that locality are published.

In order to avail himself of the remedies provided for in this Code section, it shall not be necessary for the Commissioner to allege or to prove the absence of an adequate remedy at law.

            <p>§ 25-6-2. Formation of pacts authorized; status of members of fire departments of member jurisdictions; "pact" defined
Whenever two or more jurisdictions, as defined by Code Section 25-6-1, within or adjacent to this state, by written resolution authorize their respective fire departments to render aid and assistance in the extinguishment of fires or other immediate response emergencies outside of their respective jurisdictions, they may, if they so desire, form a district mutual aid system or pact, which shall be a public corporation. It is the primary intent that such system or pact be established for fire emergencies; however, due to the diverse emergency services expected of fire departments, mutual aid systems or pacts may include responses for any form of immediate response emergency as specified by members of the system or pact. Members of fire departments of member jurisdictions shall be considered as officers of a public municipal corporation and shall enjoy the privileges, rights, exemptions, immunities, and duties of such; and this shall apply to paid, volunteer, or private members when responding to or returning from rendering aid in an emergency under a mutual aid system or a pact. As used in this chapter, "pact" means a mutual aid resource pact.

              <p>Any pact established under authority of this chapter is charged with the responsibility of establishing an overall plan or plans for carrying out the intended purpose and other provisions of this chapter. No pact may be established unless it complies with this chapter. Within the limits of funds available to it, the pact may acquire and operate property and equipment, including, but not limited to, a dispatch center and a communications center; and it may extend the advantages of group purchasing and benefits to jurisdictions that are members of the pact. Member jurisdictions shall adopt the training programs of the Georgia Fire Academy in order to ensure a basic standardization of operations and philosophy; this requirement shall not be construed as limiting the training practices or requirements of any jurisdiction, as it is intended that the programs of the Georgia Fire Academy be used to supplement the training practices and requirements of member jurisdictions. The pact shall cooperate with other state and federal agencies and with civil defense authorities on all levels. The state fire marshal may render advice, recommendations, and assistance to a pact, upon request. Members of a pact shall cooperate with the state fire marshal on matters relating to fire investigations and the enforcement of the arson statutes of the state.

(8)  "Distance" means the actual distance in feet along ground contour to the nearest house, public building, school, church, or commercial or institutional building normally occupied.

(9)  "Explosives" means any chemical compound or other substance or mechanical system intended for the purpose of producing an explosion or containing oxidizing and combustible units or other ingredients in such proportions or quantities that ignition by fire, by friction, by concussion, by percussion, or by detonator may produce an explosion capable of causing injury to persons or damage to property.

(10)  "Particle velocity" means the velocity with which an earth particle moves when vibrating or oscillating in any manner from its position of rest or elastic equilibrium.

(11)  "Person" means any individual, public or private corporation, political subdivision, government agency, municipality, industry, partnership, association, firm, trust, estate, or other entity whatsoever.(12)  "Scaled distance" or "Ds" means the actual distance (D) in feet divided by the square root of the maximum charge weight (W) in pounds that is detonated per delay period.

              <p>Seismograph measurements must be used in each individual blasting operation in which the standard table of distance is not being complied with. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a modified table for blasting operations may be established for use at a particular site, provided that the velocity limit of two inches per second of any of the three mutually perpendicular components of ground motion is not exceeded. Blasting operations without instrumentation will be considered as being within the limits set forth in this subsection if, at a specified location on at least five blasts, instrumentation has shown that the maximum peak particle velocity of any of the three mutually perpendicular components of ground motion at the specified location is 50 percent or less than the limit set forth in this subsection, provided that on all future blasts the scaled distance is equal to or greater than the scaled distance for the instrumented blast.</p>

The notice requirements provided by Code Section 25-9-6 shall not be required of persons performing emergency excavations or excavation in extraordinary circumstances; provided, however, that any person who engages in an emergency excavation or excavation in extraordinary circumstances shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing utility facilities and sewer laterals; provided, further, that any person who engages in an emergency excavation or excavation in extraordinary circumstances shall give notice of the emergency excavation as soon as practical to the UPC. In giving such notice, such person must specifically identify the dangerous condition involved. If it is later determined that the excavation did not qualify as an emergency excavation, all liabilities and penalties will accrue as if no notice had been given.

                <p>(A) The commission is not authorized to impose civil penalties on any local governing authority except as provided in this paragraph. The commission may recommend training for local governing authorities in response to any probable or proven violation. Civil penalties may be recommended for or imposed on any local governing authority for refusal to comply with the requirements of Code Section 25-9-7 or for other violations of Code Section 25-9-7 that result in injury to people, damage to property, or the interruption of utility service in the event that investigators find that a local governing authority has demonstrated a pattern of willful noncompliance. Civil penalties may be recommended or imposed on or after January 1, 2006, for violations of provisions of this chapter other than Code Section 25-9-7 in the event that investigators find that the severity of an excavation violation warrants civil penalties or that a local governing authority has demonstrated a pattern of willful noncompliance. Any such civil penalty shall be recommended or imposed in accordance with a tiered penalty structure designed for local governing authorities. In the event that the investigators determine that a local governing authority has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, the investigators shall not recommend a civil penalty. For purposes of this subsection "refusal to comply" means that a utility facility owner or operator does not respond in PRIS to a locate request, does not respond to a direct telephone call to designate their facilities, or other such direct refusal. Refusal to comply does not mean a case where the volume of requests or some other mitigating circumstance prevents the utility owner or operator from locating in accordance with Code Section 25-9-7.
(B)  No later than January 1, 2006, the advisory committee shall recommend to the commission for adoption a tiered penalty structure for local governing authorities. Such structure shall take into accoun</p>

                <p>If commission investigators find that a probable violation has occurred, they may recommend training in lieu of penalties to any person for any violation. The commission shall provide suggestions for corrective action to any person requesting such assistance. Commission investigators shall make recommended findings or offers of settlement to the respondent.</p>

                <p>Any respondent may accept or disagree with the settlement recommended by the investigators. If the respondent disagrees with the recommended settlement, the respondent may dispute the settlement recommendation to the advisory committee. The advisory committee shall then render a recommendation either supporting the investigators' recommendation, rejecting the investigators' recommendation, or substituting its own recommendation. With respect to an investigation of any probable violation committed by a local governing authority, any recommendation by the advisory committee shall be in accordance with the provisions of paragraph</p>

In its deliberations the advisory committee shall consider the gravity of the violation or violations; the degree of the respondent's culpability; the respondent's history of prior offenses; and such other mitigating factors as may be appropriate. If the advisory committee determines that a respondent has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, the committee shall not recommend civil penalties against the respondent. To the extent that a respondent does not accept a settlement agreement or request to dispute the recommendation of the investigators to the advisory committee, the respondent shall be assigned to a hearing officer or administrative law judge.</p>
