            <p>§ 12-10-61. Authority of Governor to execute compact with designated states; legislative approval of compact; text of compact

The Governor on behalf of this state is authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the following form, with any one or more of the states of Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the General Assembly signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such compact:

"Article I. The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the Southeastern region of the United States by the development of integrated forest fire plans, by the maintenance of adequate forest fire fighting services by the member States, by providing for mutual aid in fighting forest fires among the compacting States of the region and with States which are party to other regional forest fire protection compacts or agreements, and for more adequate forest protection.

Article II. This compact shall become operative immediately as to those States ratifying it whenever any two or more of the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, which are contiguous have ratified it and Congress has given consent thereto. Any State not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member State may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member States.Article III. In each State, the State forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control shall act as compact administrator for that State and shall consult with like officials of the other member States and shall implement cooperation between such States in forest fire prevention and control.
The compact administrators of the member States shall coordinate the services of the member States and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of this compact.

There shall be established an advisory committee of legislators, forestry commission representatives, and forestry or forest products industries representatives which shall meet from time to time with the compact administrators. Each member State shall name one member of the Senate and one member of the House of Representatives who shall be designated by that State's commission on interstate cooperation, or if said commission cannot constitutionally designate the said members, they shall be designated in accordance with laws of that State; and the Governor of each member State shall appoint two representatives, one of whom shall be associated with forestry or forest products industries to comprise the membership of the advisory committee. Action shall be taken by a majority of the compacting States, and each State shall be entitled to one vote.

The compact administrators shall formulate and, in accordance with need, from time to time, revise a regional forest fire plan for the member States.

It shall be the duty of each member State to formulate and put in effect a forest fire plan for that State and take such measures as may be necessary to integrate such forest fire plan with the regional forest fire plan formulated by the compact administrators.

Article IV. Whenever the State forest fire control agency of a member State requests aid from the State forest fire control agency of any other member State in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires, it shall be the duty of the State forest fire control agency of that State to render all possible aid to the requesting agency which is consonant with the maintenance of protection at home.Article V. Whenever the forces of any member State are rendering outside aid pursuant to the request of another member State under this compact, the employees of such State shall, under the direction of the officers of the State to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers (except the power of arrest), duties, rights, privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the State to which they are rendering aid.
No member State or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance, or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith: Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as relieving any person from liability for his own negligent act or omission, or as imposing liability for such negligent act or omission upon any State.

All liability, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, that may arise either under the laws of the requesting State or under the laws of the aiding State or under the laws of a third State on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting State.

Any member State rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be</p>

              <p>Once adopted by the three states and ratified by the United States Congress, this Compact shall have the full force and effect of federal law, and shall supersede state and local laws operating contrary to the provisions herein or the purposes of this Compact; provided, however, nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective signatory states relating to water quality, and riparian rights as among persons exclusively within each state.ARTICLE XI PUBLIC PARTICIPATION 
All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public. The signatory parties recognize the importance and necessity of public participation in activities of the Commission, including the development and adoption of the initial allocation formula and any modification thereto. Prior to the adoption of the initial allocation formula, the Commission shall adopt procedures ensuring public participation in the development, review, and approval of the initial allocation formula and any subsequent modification thereto. At a minimum, public notice to interested parties and a comment period shall be provided. The Commission shall respond in writing to relevant comments.ARTICLE XII FUNDING AND EXPENSES OF THE COMMISSION 
Commissioners shall serve without compensation from the ACF Basin Commission. All general operational funding required by the Commission and agreed to by the voting members shall obligate each state to pay an equal share of such agreed upon funding. Funds remitted to the Commission by a state in payment of such obligation shall not lapse; provided, however, that if any state fails to remit payment within 90 days after payment is due, such obligation shall terminate and any state which has made payment may have such payment returned. Costs of attendance and participation at meetings of the Commission by the Federal Commissioner shall be paid by the United States.ARTICLE XIII DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public. The signatory parties recognize the importance and necessity of public participation in activities of the Commission, including the development and adoption of the initial allocation formula and any modification thereto.

At a minimum, public notice to interested parties and a comment period shall be provided. The Commission shall respond in writing to relevant comments.ARTICLE XII FUNDING AND EXPENSES OF THE COMMISSION

            <p>§ 12-11-2. Legislative findingsThe General Assembly finds and declares that:
(1)  A central element in the development of the state's young persons is the provision of meaningful work experience to teach the value of labor and membership in a productive society;

(2)  There is a need for a comprehensive youth development program including meaningful work experience and basic education to address unemployment, undereducation, and lack of life-coping skills among young adults;

(3)  This state has a continuing need for involvement by young persons in public works and services, especially relating to conservation, the enhancement of our natural resources, and the provision of human services;

(4)  The state is still benefiting from the wide range of public works accomplished by the conservation corps many years ago and that a similar program will likewise benefit future generations; and

(5)  Values of hard work, public spiritedness, group achievement and cooperation, resource conservation, and environmental appreciation can and should be transmitted to society's youth through a conservation corps program.

            <p>§ 12-12-14. Injunctions; restraining and other orders
Whenever in the judgment of the director any person has engaged in or is about to engage in any act or practice which constitutes or will constitute an unlawful action under this chapter, the director may make application to the superior court of the county in which such person resides or in which jurisdiction is appropriate for an order enjoining such an act or practice or for an order requiring compliance with this chapter.

            <p>§ 12-12-15. Imminent and substantial danger; remedies of director
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the director, upon receipt of evidence that a project is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, may bring an action as provided in Code Section 12-12-14 to restrain immediately any person causing or contributing to the alleged danger or to take such other action as may be necessary. If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the health of persons solely by commencement of such a civil action, the director may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the health of persons who are or may be affected by such project. Notwithstanding Code Section 12-12-17, such order shall be immediately effective for a period of not more than 48 hours unless the director brings an action under Code Section 12-12-14 before the expiration of such period. Whenever the director brings such an action within such period, such order shall be effective for such a period of time as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter.

            <p>§ 12-15-2. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds that there is a need for sewage holding tanks to accommodate the sewage from flush toilets which serve the needs of employees at construction sites during the temporary period of construction and the needs of the public at special events, and that such sewage holding tanks should be regulated to ensure that they are maintained in a clean, sanitary, and functional condition for the protection of human health, safety, and welfare. Where such sewage holding tanks are utilized, their construction, maintenance, and operation shall meet the standards of this article and all health and safety regulations applicable thereto.

            <p>§ 12-3-91. Legislative findings and declaration of purposeThe General Assembly finds that there is an increasing nation-wide concern over the deterioration of man's natural environment in rural as well as urban areas; that there is a serious need to study the long-term effects of our civilization on our natural environment; that while the State of Georgia is still richly endowed with relatively undisturbed natural areas, these areas are rapidly being drastically modified and even destroyed by human activities; that it is of the utmost importance to preserve examples of such areas in their natural state, not only for scientific and educational purposes but for the general well-being of our society and its people. Therefore, it shall be the purpose and function of the Department of Natural Resources to:
(1)  Identify natural areas in the State of Georgia which are of unusual ecological significance;(2)  Use its influence and take any steps within its power to secure the preservation of such areas in an undisturbed natural state in order that such areas may:
(A)  Be studied scientifically;

(B)  Be used for educational purposes;

(C)  Serve as examples of nature to the general public; and

(D)  Enrich the quality of our environment for present and future generations; and

(3)  Recommend areas or parts of areas for recreational use.

      (B)  Bicycle trails.  These would be located in urban, suburban, or rural areas and should be easily accessible to population centers. Bicycle trails in urban areas should provide an acceptable alternative to motorized transportation, and the cyclist should be protected from motorized traffic; 

      (C)  Horse trails.  These may extend through urban, suburban, rural, or wilderness areas and should be accessible to population centers. Supporting facilities may include stables, corrals, drinking water, primitive campsites, and shelter; 

      (D)  Rural hiking trails.  These would be accessible to, but not within, population centers and may traverse areas of historic or scenic interest, pastureland, and woodland. Activities would include hiking, walking, jogging, touring, camping, and fishing. Support facilities may include simple toilet facilities, drinking water, primitive campsites, and picnic tables and benches; 

      (E)  Primitive hiking trails.  These would be primarily to provide the beauty and inspiration of the wilderness experience to an increasingly urban society. They may traverse small areas of pastoral land or roadway but would be largely in undisturbed wilderness areas. Any facilities should be primitive in nature and widely separated; 

      (F)  Historical trails.  These would emphasize important events in the history of Georgia and would be appropriately marked to allow the user to become familiar with such history; 

      (G)  Bikeways.  These would be publicly owned and maintained paved paths, ways, or trails designated and signed as bicycle routes and located in urban, suburban, or rural areas. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the routes of such bikeways shall be determined by the local governing authority wherein such bikeways would be located and shall be approved by the Department of Transportation; 

      (H)  Combination trails.  These would be trails consisting of combinations of any of the types of trails described in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of this paragraph;

(2)  The use of the trails should be limited to those activities for which intended, and appropriate steps should be taken to enforce this policy;

(3)  The physical facilities provided for the trails, such as trail markers, signs, toilet facilities, shelters, drinking water, campsites, picnic tables, and parking areas, should be in keeping with the intended use of the trails and with health, sanitation, and safety requirements but should make minimum changes in the natural environment consistent with those objectives;

(4)  Assistance and encouragement should be provided for local governments in the development of trails, and a procedure should be adopted whereby such trails could be regulated and maintained as a part of the system;

(5)  The advice, cooperation, and assistance of other state agencies, local governments and agencies thereof, and private associations and organizations should be sought in developing and maintaining the system;

(6)  Planning and developing the system should be coordinated with the regional commissions and the Department of Community Affairs;

(7)  Trails should be planned, constructed, and maintained on a long-term basis, and in connection therewith long-term control of the land making up the trails should be established by the acquisition in fee simple of rights of way to such land or by leases, easements, or other appropriate long-term agreements; and where feasible, rights of way should be of sufficient width to preserve the recreational, scenic, or historical uniqueness of the trail; and

(8)  A program for the education of the public on the effective use and care of trails should be established.

            <p>§ 12-3-600. Legislative findings; policy of state
The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide for the conservation of nongame species of wildlife for the benefit and nonconsumptive use of the citizens of Georgia. Historically, wildlife conservation programs have been focused on the more recreationally and commercially important game species. As a consequence, such programs have been largely financed by hunting and fishing license revenues and by federal assistance based on excise taxes on certain hunting and fishing equipment. These traditional financing mechanisms are neither adequate nor fully appropriate to meet the needs of nongame wildlife conservation programs and wildlife habitat acquisition programs which enhance the protection of nongame species. It is the policy of this state to enable and encourage citizens voluntarily to support nongame wildlife conservation programs and wildlife habitat acquisition programs.

            <p>§ 12-4-141. Legislative purpose
The State of Georgia finds that caves are uncommon geologic phenomena and that the minerals deposited therein may be rare and occur in unique forms of great beauty which are irreplaceable if destroyed. It is also found that the wildlife which have evolved to live in caves are unusual and of limited numbers, and many are rare and endangered species, and that caves are a natural conduit for ground-water flow and are highly subject to water pollution, which has far-reaching effects transcending man's property boundaries. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state and the intent of this article to protect these unique natural resources.

The General Assembly realizes that the nutrients contained in many of these products serve a valuable purpose in increasing their overall effectiveness, but the General Assembly is also aware that they overstimulate the growth of aquatic life and are causing, and will eventually lead to, an acceleration of the natural eutrophication process of our state's water resources which can result in a lower quality of life and thereby create an undesirable environment in which the citizens of the state would not want to live and do business.

              <p>Any person who owns or operates a facility of any type or who desires to erect, modify, alter, or commence operation of a facility of any type which results or will result in the discharge of pollutants from a point source into the waters of the state shall obtain from the director a permit to make such discharge. Any person desiring to erect, modify, alter, or commence operation of a facility which will result in such discharge but which is not discharging such pollutants as of July 1, 1974, must obtain such permit prior to the discharge of same. Any person who is operating a facility which results in such discharge as of July 1, 1974, may continue to make such discharge pending final action by the director on the application for such discharge permit, provided that such application has been filed with the director by September 29, 1974; and provided, further, that such discharge does not present an immediate health hazard to the public. The director, under the conditions he prescribes, may require the submission of such plans, specifications, and other information as he deems relevant in connection with the issuance of such permits. The director may, after public notice and opportunity for public hearing, issue a permit which authorizes the person to make such discharge, upon condition that such discharge meets or will meet, pursuant to any schedule of compliance included in such permit, all water quality standards, effluent limitations, and all other requirements established pursuant to this article.</p>

(iv)  For all permits for which such modification, amendment, transfer, or assignment is effective on or after April 20, 2018, and for which no water-measuring device is installed, the permittee shall have one year from the updated effective date stated on the revised permit for farm use to have an acceptable type of water-measuring device installed, to have such device in operation at each point of permitted withdrawal, and to notify the division in writing once the installation has occurred. The division shall approve or disapprove the installation within 60 days of the date of notification. The permittee shall be responsible for all associated costs.

              <p>of this Code section, permits may be granted for any period of time not less than ten years, unless the applicant requests a shorter period of time, nor more than 50 years. The director may base the duration of such permits on any reasonable system of classification based upon but not necessarily limited to such factors as source of supply and type of use. In evaluating any application for a permit for the use of water, the director shall evaluate the condition of the water supply to assure that the supply is adequate to meet the multiple needs of the citizens of the state as can reasonably be projected for the term of the permit and ensure that the issuance of such permit is based upon water development and conservation plans for the applicant and for the region in accordance with Article 8 of this chapter. Such water development and conservation plans for the applicant and for the region shall promote the conservation and reuse of water within the state, guard against a shortage of water within the state, promote the efficient use of the water resource, and be consistent with the public welfare of the state, in accordance with Article 8 of this chapter. The board shall promulgate regulations for implementation of this subsection, including provisions for review of such permits periodically or upon a substantial reduction in average annual volume of the water resource which adversely affects water supplies to determine that the permittee continues in compliance with the conditions of the permit and that the plan continues to meet the overall supply requirements for the term of the permit. Regional water plans shall be developed in accordance with Article 8 of this chapter. Such regional plans shall include water development, conservation, and sustainable use and shall be based upon detailed scientific analysis of the water source, the projected future condition of the resource, current demand, and estimated future demands on the resource, in accordance with Article</p>

(A)  May conduct its duties with division staff and may contract with other persons to conduct any of its duties;

(C)  Shall develop a priority system for the installation of devices for measurement of farm uses of water at the points of those withdrawals for which a permit was issued as of July 1, 2003. The division may refine the priority system from time to time based on the amount of funding received by the division, considerations regarding cost effectiveness, new technical information, changes in resource use or conditions, or other factors as deemed relevant by the director;

(D)  Shall, on behalf of the state, contract for the purchase and installation of that subset of water-measuring devices according to the priority system required by this Code section and no charge shall be made to the permittee for such costs. However, when the division assesses the site or attempts to install such water-measuring devices and finds that the site lacks withdrawal or irrigation infrastructure, the division shall document such withdrawal or irrigation infrastructure conditions, and notify the permittee in writing that a state funded water-measuring device or devices could not be installed, that a device or devices are still required. After the expiration of five years such permittee shall be responsible for having an acceptable type of water-measuring device installed and placed into operation and all associated costs. The permittee shall notify the division in writing once the installation has occurred. The division shall approve or disapprove the installation within 60 days of the date of notification;

              <p>The General Assembly declares its intent and the public policy of this state that the state plans, regulates, and controls the withdrawal and the use of the waters of the state under the laws of Georgia to protect the public health, safety, and welfare; and the granting of any water withdrawal permit allows the permittee to use the water solely for the stated purposes described in the permit so long as such use is consistent with the public welfare of the state and upon such conditions as the state may prescribe. This declaration of intent shall also apply to all aspects of this article.</p>

              <p>The General Assembly finds that the use of water resources for the state for agricultural purposes is of vital importance to Georgia and southwest Georgia in particular; the protection of flows in the Flint River and its tributaries is necessary for a healthy riverine ecosystem and a healthy population of aquatic life; the use of water resources during drought conditions may interfere with public and private rights; the economic well-being of the State of Georgia is dependent on a strong and efficient agricultural industry; the wise use of water, the protection of stream flows, and the economic well-being of the state will be furthered by proper water allocation in periods of drought; and programs to augment stream flows or provide incentives to ensure that certain irrigated lands are temporarily not irrigated during severe droughts will promote the wise use of water resources, and the protection of stream flows for habitat critical for aquatic life, and the economic well-being of the state.</p>

              <p>of this Code section by and through the authority with appropriated funds for the purposes of this article, grants, and other sources of revenue. The General Assembly intends for the total maximum balance of the unexpended drought protection funds during any fiscal year not to exceed $30 million. In the event the total balance of unexpended drought protection funds at the end of a fiscal year is less than $5 million, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the total balance of unexpended drought protection funds be replenished to at least $10 million at the earliest possible time. Appropriation of funds for inclusion in and as part of the drought protection funds shall be deemed consistent with this declaration of legislative intent.

The authority shall administer the drought protection funds provided to it for purposes of this article and shall make expenditures from said funds in accordance with and at the direction of the director pursuant to Code Sections 12-5-546 and 12-5-547. With the prior consent and approval of the director, the authority is authorized to expend a portion of the drought protection funds for incidental costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the authority in connection with its administration of the drought protection funds for such things as postage, office supplies, and prorated salaries and wages of personnel assigned the tasks associated with management of the drought protection funds. The authority is further authorized and directed to invest the unexpended balance of the drought protection funds in the same manner as other funds under its control. Any interest or other revenues earned on the principal of the drought protection funds shall be added to the unexpended balance of the drought protection funds and become a part thereof. Upon request of the director, the authority shall provide such accounting information to the director as may be reasonably necessary for the director to perform his or her duties and functions pursuant to this article. All moneys deposited in the drought protection funds shall be deemed to be contractually obligated and shall not lapse to the general fund.

              <p>of this Code section, the division may determine the total number of acres of irrigated land, serviced by irrigation systems located within one or more of the affected areas, that must not be irrigated that year in order to maintain the acceptable Flint River basin stream flows. Upon such determination, the division may conduct an irrigation reduction auction whereby a permittee of an irrigation system located within the affected areas is given an opportunity to enter into an agreement with the division, agreeing that in exchange for a certain sum of money per acre of irrigated land serviced by the irrigation system, the permittee will not irrigate those particular acres for the remainder of that calendar year. The authority shall pay the sum so agreed upon when so directed by the director from the unexpended balance of the drought protection funds. In conducting the irrigation reduction auction, the division may establish a maximum dollar amount per acre to be expended from the drought protection funds for such purposes.</p>

No expenditure of funds under this article shall be considered full or partial compensation for any losses, financial or otherwise, experienced due to nonirrigation; a lease or repurchase of any irrigation permit issued by the director; or an acknowledgment by the State of Georgia of a property right in any permit issued by the director.

            <p>§ 12-5-547. Director's orders
If the director determines that the total number of nonirrigated acres needed during a given year cannot be sufficiently obtained through the irrigation reduction auction held in accordance with Code Section 12-5-546, the director is authorized to issue an order, in accordance with rules adopted by the board, requiring certain permittees not to irrigate a specified number of acres of irrigated land until the end of the calendar year. When issuing such orders, the director shall begin with the permittees whose withdrawal permits were issued most recently and then work chronologically backward with each order issued. A permittee who is issued such an order shall be compensated for such restriction if such permittee applied to the division for a surface-water or ground-water withdrawal permit prior to December 1, 1999, received a surface-water or ground-water withdrawal permit from the division prior to December 1, 2000, and is able to demonstrate actual previous irrigation on the same acres of land which the owner has been ordered not to irrigate. The per acre dollar amount received by a permittee pursuant to this Code section shall be equal to the average agreed upon sum per acre paid pursuant to the irrigation reduction auction during the same year.

              <p>The General Assembly recognizes the value of the metropolitan North Georgia area watersheds for water supply, recreation, habitat for fish and wildlife, economic prosperity, and quality of life. The General Assembly finds that adequate supplies of clean water for drinking and other purposes constitute the lifeblood of the metropolitan North Georgia area and are, therefore, essential to the health, welfare, and economic progress of the area. The purpose of this article is to create a planning entity dedicated to developing comprehensive regional and watershed-specific plans to be implemented by local governments in the district. These plans will protect water quality and public water supplies in and downstream of the region, protect recreational values of the waters in and downstream of the region, and minimize potential adverse impacts of development on waters in and downstream of the region.</p>

            <p>§ 12-6-201. Legislative findingsThe General Assembly finds that:
(1)  The natural occurrence of pine straw constitutes a significant economic resource for owners of timbered property;

(2)  Such owners have been victimized by continuous and repeated trespasses onto their lands by persons engaged in harvesting pine straw and have been deprived of the economic benefit of such resources; and

(3)  The repeated trespasses onto private property by certain persons engaged in the harvesting and baling of pine straw constitute an organized and methodical deprivation of the rights of others, necessitating the enactment of this article.

              <p>The General Assembly finds that certain real property in Georgia, because it exhibits unique natural characteristics, special historical significance, or particular recreational value, constitutes a valuable heritage which should be protected to provide benefits to all Georgians, now and in the future. The General Assembly specifically recognizes that the forest lands and resources of the state are a natural resource of great economic value to the citizens of the state, not only for the potential production of forest products which they can provide, but also for the enormously valuable natural benefits they impart to the citizens of Georgia, such as air and water quality improvements, water storage, control of erosion, temperature moderation, habitat for native plants and wildlife, and opportunities for recreation in a natural, historic Georgia environment. Natural forested lands also allow present and future citizens to gain an understanding of the prehistoric and early culture of this region. Commercial forests provide traditional jobs, support our economy, and reflect the importance this industry has had in the development of Georgia. The General Assembly further finds that many of the forest resources of the state are under pressure to be converted to other uses because of Georgia's rapid progress and increased population over the past decades. As forest lands are converted to other uses and irreparably altered, a valuable part of our cultural heritage is lost as well as the natural benefits those forest lands provide.</p>

              <p>The General Assembly declares, therefore, that there is a compelling public need to preserve forest lands as an element of Georgia's heritage. The General Assembly asserts the public interest in the state's heritage by creating the Forest Heritage Trust Program, which shall be the responsibility of the Governor and the State Forestry Commission and which shall seek to protect this heritage through the acquisition of fee simple title or lesser interests in valuable properties and by utilization of other available methods.

            <p>§ 12-7-2. Legislative findings; policy of state and intent of chapter
It is found that soil erosion and sediment deposition onto lands and into waters within the watersheds of this state are occurring as a result of widespread failure to apply proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities and that such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of state waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resource uses. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state and the intent of this chapter to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities and programs of this state and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a state-wide comprehensive soil erosion and sediment control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air, and other resources of this state.

3.  The Commission must set and approve its first annual budget as soon as practicable after its initial meeting. Host states for disposal facilities must begin imposition of the special fees and surcharges provided for in this section as soon as practicable after becoming party states, and must remit to the Commission funds resulting from collection of such special fees and surcharges within 60 days of their receipt.

i.  The Commission must keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. An independent certified public accountant shall annually audit all receipts and disbursements of Commission funds, and submit an audit report to the Commission.

2.  Except as specifically provided in this Compact, nothing in this Compact shall be construed to alter the incidence of liability of any kind for any act, omission, course of conduct, or on account of any casual or other relationships. Generators, transporters of wastes, and owners and operators of sites shall be liable for their acts, omissions, conduct, or relationships in accordance with all laws relating thereto.Article V.  Development and Operation of Facilities 
a.  Any party state which becomes a host state in which a regional facility is operated shall not be designated by the Compact Commission as a host state for an additional regional facility until each party state has fulfilled its obligation, as determined by the Commission, to have a regional facility operated within its borders.

b.  A host state desiring to close a regional facility located within its borders may do so only after notifying the Commission in writing of its intention to do so and the reasons therefor. Such notification shall be given to the Commission at least four years prior to the intended date of closure. Notwithstanding the four year notice require</p>

            <p>§ 12-8-160. Legislative findings and declarationsThe General Assembly finds and declares that:
(1)  The management of solid waste can pose a wide range of hazards to public health and safety and to the environment;

(2)  Packaging comprises a significant percentage of the overall solid waste stream;

(3)  The presence of heavy metals in packaging is a concern in light of the likely presence of heavy metals in emissions or ash when packaging is incinerated or in leachate when packaging is landfilled;

(4)  Lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium, on the basis of available scientific and medical evidence, are of particular concern;

(5)  It is desirable as a first step in reducing the toxicity of packaging waste to eliminate the addition of heavy metals to packaging; and

(6)  It is desirable to achieve reduction in toxicity without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of postconsumer materials in the production of packaging and its components.

The initial compliance status report or a corrective action plan submitted for any qualifying property under Code Section 12-8-207 shall be deemed to be an application to participate in the program described in this article and shall be submitted in such form as may be prescribed by the director. By making said initial submission, the prospective purchaser agrees to the provisions of this Code section. A nonrefundable application review fee of $3,000.00 shall be submitted with the application. Within 30 days of the receipt of the application, the director shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the applicant an estimate of the projected costs of the division to review the application. The director may, at any time during the application review process, invoice the applicant for any costs of the division in reviewing the application that exceed the initial application review fee. Failure to remit payment within 30 days of receipt of invoice may cause rejection of the application. The director may not issue a written concurrence with a certification of compliance if there is an outstanding fee to be paid by the prospective purchaser.

Whenever in the judgment of the director any person has engaged in or is about to engage in any act or practice which constitutes or will constitute an unlawful action under this article, he may make application to the superior court of the county in which the unlawful act or practice has been or is about to be engaged in, or in which jurisdiction is appropriate, for an order enjoining such act or practice or for an order requiring compliance with this article. Upon a showing by the director that such person has engaged in or is about to engage in any such act or practice, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order shall be granted without the necessity of showing lack of an adequate remedy of law.

Whenever the director has reason to believe that a violation of any provisions of this article or rule or regulation of the Board of Natural Resources or any order of the director has occurred, he may issue such orders and take such actions as are authorized by this article to require such person or persons to remedy the violation so as to be in compliance with this article. Any order issued by the director under this Code section shall be signed by the director. Any such order shall become final unless the person or persons named therein request in writing a hearing before the department pursuant to Code Section 12-9-15.

            <p>§ 12-9-14. Powers of director in situations involving imminent and substantial danger to public health
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the director, upon receipt of evidence that a source or facility or combination of sources or facilities is presenting imminent and substantial danger to the health of persons, may bring an action as provided in Code Section 12-9-12 immediately to restrain any person causing or contributing to the alleged pollution through the emission of air contaminants to stop the emission of air pollutants causing or contributing to such pollution or to take such other action as may be necessary. If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the health of persons solely by commencement of such a civil action, the director, with the concurrence of the Governor, may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the health of persons who are, or may be, affected by such pollution source or facility. Prior to issuing an order under this Code section, the director shall consult with local authorities in order to confirm the correctness of the information on which action proposed to be taken is based and to ascertain the action which such authorities are or will be taking. Notwithstanding Code Sections 12-9-12, 12-9-13, and 12-9-15, such order shall be immediately effective for a period of not more than 24 hours unless the director brings an action under the first sentence of this Code section before the expiration of such period. Whenever the director brings such an action within such period, such order shall be effective for a period of 48 hours or such longer period as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter.

A person shall also be considered aggrieved or adversely affected solely for purposes of administrative and judicial review pursuant to this article if he actively participated in the public hearing and comment process and the director decided the matter adverse to his interest.  A continuous and substantial involvement in the review process, including attendance at public hearings and submission in writing of specific objections to the permit as proposed and specific suggested permit conditions or limitations which the person believes are required to implement the provisions of this article, shall constitute active participation.  In the event the director asserts in response to the petition before the administrative law judge that the petitioner is not aggrieved or adversely affected, the administrative law judge shall take evidence and hear arguments on this issue and thereafter make a ruling on this issue before continuing with the hearing. The burden of going forward with evidence on this issue shall rest with the petitioner.  The hearing and review procedure provided in this Code section is to the exclusion of all other means of hearing or review.

          <content>
            <p>§ 12-9-41. Legislative findingsWith respect to the ambient air quality in this state, the General Assembly finds that:
(1)  Some counties of the state have ambient air levels of ozone or carbon monoxide in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for such pollutants specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 7401, et seq., as amended; and that the USEPA has determined that under certain conditions, such excess levels in such counties are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such counties;

(2)  In order to comply with federal health related air standards in counties where the USEPA has determined that excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles, it is necessary to monitor and limit emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such counties;

(3)  The USEPA has the duty, by law, to designate those areas of the state violating the NAAQS and has and will, from time to time, as facts dictate, designate those counties or areas of the state violating the NAAQS for ozone and carbon monoxide, and the USEPA has the duty, by law, to establish criteria to determine whether the excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles in such counties;

(4)  With respect to such designations, when counties or areas are designated to have ambient air levels of pollutants in excess of the NAAQS and according to the criteria established by the USEPA the excess levels of pollution are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles, the state is under a duty to provide a plan for reducing the ambient air levels of pollutants found to be in excess of the NAAQS if the state is to maintain its authority to permit new or expanded industry in such county or area; and

(5)  Failure of the state to provide a legally enforceable mechanism pursuant to state law for reducing such pollutants in such counties or areas to levels within the NAAQS will result in such a mechanism subsequently being devised by USEPA and enforced in such areas pursuant to federal law and could result in a significant loss of federal funds for sewage treatment plants, transportation projects, and air quality improvement funds; further, new or expanded industry which would contribute to the ambient air level of such pollutants would be subject to significant new emission control requirements to offset increased emissions.

It is declared to be the public policy of the State of Georgia as expressed in this article to preserve, protect, and improve air quality in those counties or areas of the state where the ambient air levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are in excess of the NAAQS, as designated by the USEPA and such levels, according to the criteria established by the USEPA, are directly related to the emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such counties or areas of the state; and to that end to provide a legally enforceable mechanism for the attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS of such pollutants in such counties or areas of the state by requiring that emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such counties or areas of the state; shall be subject to inspection of exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, inspection and maintenance of emission control equipment, and inspection and maintenance of on-board diagnostics to ensure compliance with such emission standards.

The provisions and requirements of this article shall apply in each county or any portion of a county which has been designated by the USEPA in the Code of Federal Regulations as a county or area included within a nonattainment area and which the board designates, through regulation, as a county or area where the excess levels of ozone or carbon monoxide or both are directly related to emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, or carbon monoxide from responsible motor vehicles registered in such county or area. This article shall continue to apply in each such county or portion of a county so designated until the USEPA removes such county or area from the Code of Federal Regulations as a nonattainment area and approves an air quality implementation plan which allows the state to maintain the NAAQS in such county without a vehicle inspection program.

                <p>In the event a windshield bearing a valid emission inspection sticker is replaced, a new emission inspection sticker may be issued for such vehicle within 30 days after the replacement of the windshield without the necessity of reinspection if the owner of the vehicle executes an affidavit in a form furnished by the director stating that the windshield of his or her vehicle has been replaced and giving such other information as the director may require and pays to the inspection station a fee in an amount equal to the actual administrative cost of issuing such a sticker which shall be no less than the cost of the sticker plus the cost of computer access. The vehicle may be operated on the highways without an emission inspection sticker for 30 days after the replacement of the windshield if proof of the date of such replacement is carried in the vehicle.
In all cases, the new emission inspection sticker or duplicate certificate of emission inspection shall be valid only for the remainder of the period for which the replaced emission inspection sticker or certificate of emission inspection was to be valid.</p>

            <p>§ 12-9-57. Effect of federal Clean Air Act requirements; repeal of article
This article shall remain of force and effect only so long as the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 7401, et seq., as amended, requires the State of Georgia to maintain and enforce the inspection plan and program provided for in this article in order to reduce the ambient air levels of ozone or carbon monoxide which exceed the levels specified by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for such pollutants specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to said act. Upon the effective date of an amendment to the federal Clean Air Act which allows the State of Georgia to discontinue the maintenance and enforcement of the inspection program provided for in this article without the imposition of sanctions against the State of Georgia such as the loss of federal funds for sewage treatment plants, transportation projects, air quality improvement projects, a moratorium on development within any area of the state, or other substantial penalty, this article shall be repealed.

              <p>The director of the Environmental Protection Division of the department is authorized and urged to study and review the use of gasoline additives in this state and to develop rules and regulations not later than January 1, 2008, for consideration by the Board of Natural Resources to provide for a phase out of the permissible use of gasoline containing MTBE in a manner designed to coordinate such phase out with other states adjacent to this state to the extent practicable; and the board is authorized to adopt rules and regulations for such purpose. In developing such rules and regulations, the director is urged to consider the need to ensure adequate supplies of gasoline in this state, environmental issues such as air quality and ground-water protection, the overall benefits and concerns with various gasoline additives, the use of additives by adjacent states, and the viability of ethanol for use as an additive to the greatest extent practicable.
