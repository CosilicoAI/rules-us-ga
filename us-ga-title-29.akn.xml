The court shall award reasonable compensation to a temporary substitute conservator and such compensation shall be the only compensation or commission paid to the temporary substitute conservator for services performed in that capacity.

              <p>All guardianships ordered pursuant to this chapter shall be designed to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence in the adult and shall be ordered only to the extent necessitated by the adult's actual and adaptive limitations after a determination that less restrictive alternatives to the guardianship are not available or appropriate.

(b.1)  If no other person is available to serve as guardian of the ward, the judge may appoint a public guardian in accordance with Chapter 10 of this title. In the event the court determines that there is no public guardian registered in accordance with Chapter 10 of this title appropriately available to serve as guardian for a ward, the court may appoint the Department of Human Services as guardian. If so appointed, the department shall designate a representative of the department to provide guardian services who shall take the oath of guardianship. If, after having been so appointed, the department presents to the court a public guardian registered in accordance with Chapter 10 of this title or some other person suitable and appropriate to serve as guardian of a ward and willing to so serve, the court shall allow the department to resign and shall appoint such public guardian or such other person. If the department is appointed pursuant to this subsection, it shall be bound by all the requirements of this chapter, except that it shall not be required to post bond or pay any cost or fee of court associated with the guardianship proceeding. If the department is appointed pursuant to this subsection and enters into a contract with an independent contractor for the provision of guardianship services, the expense of providing such services may be paid for from state funds appropriated for public guardians under Chapter 10 of this title or, upon approval of the court, from the estate of the ward.</p>

              <p>Upon the petition of any interested person, including the ward, or upon the court's own motion, the court may modify the guardianship by adjusting the duties or powers of the guardian, as defined in Code Sections 29-4-22 and 29-4-23, or the powers of the ward, as defined in Code Sections 29-4-20 and 29-4-21, or by making other appropriate adjustments to reflect the extent of the current capacity of the ward or other circumstances of the guardianship. Except for good cause shown, the court shall order that notice of the petition be given, in whatever form the court deems appropriate, to the ward, the guardian, the ward's legal counsel, and the ward's conservator, if any. In any proceeding under this Code section that would expand or increase the powers of the guardian or further restrict the rights of the ward, the court shall appoint legal counsel for the ward. In all other cases, the court, in its discretion, may appoint legal counsel for the ward or a guardian ad litem, or both.</p>

              <p>The conservator must disclose promptly any conflict of interest between the conservator and the ward when it arises or becomes known to the conservator.

              <p>of this Code section and with prior approval by the court in accordance with Code Section 29-5-23, a conservator is authorized to acquire and retain every kind of property, including real, personal, or mixed and every kind of investment, specifically including, but not by way of limitation, bonds, debentures and other corporate obligations, and stocks, preferred or common, including the securities of or other interests in any open-end or closed-end management investments company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. Sections 80a-1, et seq. The propriety of an investment is to be determined by what the conservator knew or should have known at the time of the decision about the inherent nature and expected performance of a particular investment, including probable yield, the attributes of the portfolio, the general economy, and the needs of the ward and those entitled to support from the ward as they existed at the time of the decision. Any determination of liability for investment performance shall consider not only the performance of a particular investment but also the performance of the ward's portfolio as a whole. Within the limitations of such standard, a conservator may retain property properly acquired, without limitation as to time and without regard to its suitability for original purchase.</p>

If the value of the ward's bonded estate decreases, the court may permit a corresponding reduction in the value of the bond, but this reduction does not affect the liability of the surety for prior waste or misconduct of the conservator.

            <p>§ 29-5-54. Application for compensation by emergency or temporary substitute conservator; reduction of compensation to conservator
An emergency conservator or temporary substitute conservator may apply to the court for reasonable compensation after notice to interested parties in compliance with Chapter 9 of this title. The court shall award reasonable compensation to an emergency conservator or temporary substitute conservator and such compensation shall be the only compensation or commission paid to the emergency conservator or temporary substitute conservator for services performed in that capacity. For good cause, including but not limited to services performed and compensation awarded to an emergency conservator or temporary substitute conservator, the court may reduce the compensation due the conservator under other provisions of this article.

            <p>§ 29-6-1. Judges of probate courts as custodians of certain funds; authority to collect debts
The judges of the probate courts are, in their discretion, made the legal custodians and distributors of all moneys up to $15,000.00 due and owing to any minor or incapacitated adult who is in need of a conservator but who has no legal and qualified conservator; and the judges are authorized to receive and collect all such moneys arising from insurance policies, benefit societies, legacies, inheritances, or any other source. Without any appointment or qualifying order, the judge is authorized to take charge of the moneys or funds of the minor or adult by virtue of the judge's office as judge of the probate court in the county of residence of the minor or adult; provided, however, that notice shall be given to the living parents of a minor, if any, or the guardian of an adult, if any. The certificate of the judge that no legally qualified conservator has been appointed shall be conclusive and shall be sufficient authority to justify any debtor in making payment on claims made by the judge.

            <p>§ 29-7-8. Qualifications of VA guardian
Before making an appointment under this chapter, the court hearing the petition shall be satisfied that the VA guardian whose appointment is sought is a fit and proper person to be appointed. The nomination of a person by the department shall be prima-facie evidence of the person's fitness. A qualified individual shall ordinarily be preferred for appointment as VA guardian, but the court may, in the court's discretion, appoint any qualified person as VA guardian.

            <p>§ 29-7-14. Failure to file an annual accounting
If any VA guardian fails to file the accounting required by Code Section 29-7-13, the failure shall be grounds for removal. If any VA guardian fails to file any accounting within 30 days after demand is made by the court to do so, the court shall notify the surety for the VA guardian of the failure by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. Thereafter, on motion of any interested party, including the surety, or on its own motion, the court may enter an order removing the VA guardian without further notice or hearing. Every VA guardian who fails or refuses to file the accounting by the due date shall receive no commission or compensation for any service during that year unless by special order of the court the VA guardian is exonerated from all fault.

A former county guardian may file a petition with the court, a copy of which shall be served by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery upon the area office of the department, together with the VA guardian's final accounting, as to any or all VA guardianships; whereupon the court shall appoint as the VA guardian's successor the new county guardian or other person as shall be designated by the department.

            <p>§ 29-9-6. Service upon conservator or guardian
If one or more unsuccessful attempts at personal service are made by the sheriff or deputy upon a conservator or guardian appointed in this state at the last known address of the conservator or guardian that appears in the court records and it appears to the court that further attempts are likely to be futile, then service shall be sufficient upon the conservator or guardian if the citation is mailed by first-class mail to the last known address of the conservator or guardian.

              <p>All of the records relating to any minor or adult guardianship or conservatorship that is granted under this title shall be kept sealed, except for a record of the names and addresses of the minor, ward, and guardian or conservator and their legal counsel of record and the date of filing, granting, and terminating the guardianship or conservatorship. The sealed records may be examined by the ward and the ward's legal counsel, the minor, the minor's parents, and the minor's legal counsel, the guardian or conservator and the guardian or conservator's legal counsel, and any surety for the conservator and legal counsel for the surety at any time.</p>

              <p>A request by other interested parties to examine the sealed records shall be by petition to the court and the ward and guardian or conservator shall have at least 30 days' prior written notice of a hearing on the petition; provided, however, that for good cause shown to the court, the court may shorten such notice period or grant the petition without notice. The matter shall come before the court in chambers. The order allowing access shall be granted upon a finding that the public interest in granting access to the sealed records clearly outweighs the harm otherwise resulting to the privacy of the person in interest, and the court shall limit the portion of the file to which access is granted to that which is required to meet the legitimate needs of the petitioner.
