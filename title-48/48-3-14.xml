          <p>If the residence or place of business of the respondent in another state is known, the commissioner shall send by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the respondent at the known address a copy of the petition and order of service by publication and a copy of the newspaper in which each of the four notices is published with the notice plainly marked. When the Secretary of State of this state is appointed agent by law to receive service for a nonresident, a copy of the petition, of the order of service by publication, and of the newspaper in which each of the four notices is published with the notice plainly marked shall also be sent by the commissioner by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the Secretary of State. The copy of the petition and order of service by publication shall be mailed within ten days after the issuance of the order. Each copy of the newspaper shall be mailed within ten days after its publication. Thereupon, the commissioner shall file with the clerk of the superior court in which the action is pending a certificate of compliance with this subsection, which certificate shall be a part of the record of service in the case.</p>
          <p>When a defendant in fi. fa. under Code Section 48-3-13 maintains no known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service in this state other than the Secretary of State, the sworn petition shall so allege and, in addition to the allegations prescribed in subsection (c) of Code Section 48-3-13, it shall further allege facts sufficient to show that the respondent personally or by employees or agents engaged in an act or activity within the named county giving rise to the liability or obligation for the payment or collection of the tax for which the tax execution was issued and that the act or activity was not insubstantial in its quality or nature in relation to the fair administration of law. The action shall be brought in the superior court of the county in which the respondent formerly maintained a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service at the time the liability or obligation arose, if such was the case, or, otherwise, in the superior court of the county in which the act or activity giving rise to the tax liability or obligation took place. The petition shall demand service of process by publication as provided in subsection (e) of this Code section.</p>
