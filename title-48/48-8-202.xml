   (
   )
   NO $________ for the purpose of funding water and sewer projects and costs?"</p>
          <p>"If imposition of the tax is approved by the voters, such vote shall also constitute approval of the issuance of general obligation debt of ______________ in the principal amount of $________ for the above purpose."</p>
          <p>All persons desiring to vote in favor of imposing the tax shall vote "Yes" and all persons opposed to levying the tax shall vote "No." If more than one-half of the votes cast are in favor of imposing the tax, then the tax shall be imposed as provided in this article; otherwise, the tax shall not be imposed and the question of imposing the tax shall not again be submitted to the voters of the municipality until after 12 months immediately following the month in which the election was held; provided, however, that if an election date authorized under Code Section 21-2-540 occurs during the twelfth month immediately following the month in which such election was held, the question of imposing the tax may be submitted to the voters of the municipality on such date. The municipal election superintendent shall hold and conduct the election under the same rules and regulations as govern special elections. The municipal election superintendent shall canvass the returns, declare the result of the election, and certify the result to the Secretary of State and to the commissioner. The expense of the election shall be paid from municipal funds.</p>
          <p>If the issuance of general obligation debt is included and approved as provided in this Code section, then the governing authority of the municipality may incur such debt either through the issuance and validation of general obligation bonds or through the execution of a promissory note or notes or other instrument or instruments. If such debt is incurred through the issuance of general obligation bonds, such bonds and their issuance and validation shall be subject to Articles 1 and 2 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 except as specifically provided otherwise in this article. If such debt is incurred through the execution of a promissory note or notes or other instrument or instruments, no validation proceedings shall be necessary and such debt shall be subject to Code Sections 36-80-10 through 36-80-14 except as specifically provided otherwise in this article. In either event, such general obligation debt shall be payable first from the separate account in which are placed the proceeds received by the municipality from the tax authorized by this article. Such general obligation debt shall, however, constitute a pledge of the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the municipality; and any liability on such debt which is not satisfied from the proceeds of the tax authorized by this article shall be satisfied from the general funds of the municipality.</p>

If the authority to issue such debt is so approved by the voters, then such debt may be issued without further approval by the voters.</p>
