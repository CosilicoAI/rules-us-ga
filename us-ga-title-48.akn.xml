              <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Code section, the taxes imposed by Code Section 48-11-2 shall be collected and paid through the use of stamps. The commissioner shall secure stamps of such design and materials as the commissioner deems appropriate to protect the revenue and shall sell the stamps to licensed distributors at a discount of not less than 2 percent and not more than 8 percent of the value of the stamps. The exact percentage of the discount shall be based on brackets according to the volume of cigars, cigarettes, and loose or smokeless tobacco handled by the distributor pursuant to regulations promulgated by the commissioner. The commissioner shall prescribe by regulation the condition, method, and manner in which stamps are to be affixed to containers of cigars, cigarettes, and loose or smokeless tobacco.</p>

The commissioner may also prescribe by regulation an alternate method, in lieu of the sale of stamps, of collecting and paying the tax imposed on loose or smokeless tobacco. Any such regulations shall be promulgated so that use of the alternate method will result in the same revenue to the state as the state would realize through the sale of stamps to the distributors.</p>

            <p>§ 48-11-17. Amount of unpaid tax as lien against property of violators; seizure and sale; recording of lien
The amount of any unpaid tax shall be a lien against the property of any distributor or dealer who sells cigars, cigarettes, or loose or smokeless tobacco without collecting the tax and against the property of any person using or consuming cigars, cigarettes, or loose or smokeless tobacco without proper stamps affixed to the cigars, cigarettes, or loose or smokeless tobacco or without the tax paid on the cigars or loose or smokeless tobacco as otherwise provided in this chapter. The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized agents are authorized to seize the property of a delinquent distributor, dealer, or taxpayer and sell it as provided by law to satisfy the claim for taxes due under this chapter; or the commissioner may record the commissioner's lien specifying and describing the property against which the lien is effective, and the lien shall be good as against any other person until the claim for taxes is satisfied.

              <p>Any person aggrieved because of any final action or decision of the commissioner, after hearing, may appeal from the decision to the superior court of the county in which the appellant resides. The appeal shall be returnable at the same time and shall be served and returned in the same manner as required in the case of a summons in a civil action. The authority issuing the citation shall take from the appellant a bond of recognizance to the state, with surety, conditioned to prosecute the appeal and to effect and comply with the orders and decrees of the court. The action of the commissioner shall be sustained unless the court finds that the commissioner misinterpreted this chapter or that there is no evidence to support the commissioner's action. If the commissioner's action is not sustained, the court may grant equitable relief to the appellant. Upon all appeals which are denied, costs may be taxed against the appellant at the discretion of the court. No costs of any appeal shall be taxed against the state.

If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the tax.

              <p>The excise tax shall be imposed on any person or legal entity licensed by or required to pay a business or occupation tax to the governing authority imposing the tax for operating a hotel, motel, inn, lodge, tourist camp, tourist cabin, campground, or any other place in which rooms, lodgings, or accommodations are regularly furnished for value and shall apply to the furnishing for value of any room, lodging, or accommodation. Every person or entity subject to a tax levied as provided in this Code section shall, except as provided in this Code section, be liable for the tax at the applicable rate on the lodging charges actually collected or, if the amount of taxes collected from the hotel or motel guest is in excess of the total amount that should have been collected, the total amount actually collected must be remitted.

(ii)  Any tax levied as provided in this Code section is also imposed upon every person or entity who is a hotel or motel guest and who receives a room, lodging, or accommodation that is subject to the tax levied under this Code section. Every such guest subject to the tax levied under this Code section shall pay the tax to the person or entity providing the room, lodging, or accommodation. The tax shall be a debt of the person obtaining the room, lodging, or accommodation to the person or entity providing such room, lodging, or accommodation until it is paid and shall be recoverable at law by the person or entity providing such room, lodging, or accommodation in the same manner as authorized for the recovery of other debts. The person or entity collecting the tax from the hotel or motel guest shall remit the tax to the governing authority imposing the tax, and the tax remitted shall be a credit against the tax imposed by division</p>

            <p>§ 48-13-53.1. Innkeepers; selling or quitting business; withholding of purchase money by purchaser; liability of purchaser for failure to withhold purchase money
If any innkeeper liable for any tax, interest, or penalty imposed by this article sells his or her business or quits the business, he or she shall make a final return and payment within 15 days after the date of selling or quitting the business. The innkeeper's successor or assigns, if any, shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of the taxes, interest, and penalties due under this article and unpaid until the former owner produces either a receipt from the governing authority imposing the tax showing that the taxes, interest, and penalties due under this article have been paid or a certificate from the governing authority imposing the tax stating that no tax, interest, or penalty is due under this article. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the purchase money as required by this Code section, he or she shall be personally liable for the payment of any taxes, interest, and penalties accruing under this article and unpaid by any former owner or assignor. The personal liability of the purchaser in such a case shall not exceed the amount of the total purchase money, but the property being transferred shall in all cases be subject to the full amount of the tax lien arising from the delinquencies of the former owner. Paid executions may be transferred and enforced as otherwise provided by law.

              <p>When any innkeeper fails to make any return or to pay the full amount of the tax required by this article, there shall be imposed, in addition to other penalties provided by law, a penalty to be added to the tax in the amount of 5 percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, if the failure is for not more than 30 days and an additional 5 percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, for each additional 30 days or fraction of 30 days during which the failure continues. The penalty for any single violation shall not exceed 25 percent or $25.00 in the aggregate, whichever is greater. If the failure is due to providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority imposing a tax under this article in affidavit form attached to the return and remittance is made within ten days of due date, the return may be accepted exclusive of penalties and interest. In the case of a false or fraudulent return or of a failure to file a return where willful intent exists to defraud the governing authority of any tax due under this article, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due shall be assessed.</p>

              <p>When any dealer fails to make any return or to pay the full amount of the tax required by an ordinance authorized by this article, there shall be imposed, in addition to other penalties provided by law, a penalty to be added to the tax in the amount of 5 percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, if the failure is for not more than 30 days and an additional 5 percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, for each additional 30 days or fraction of 30 days during which the failure continues. The penalty for any single violation shall not exceed 25 percent or $25.00 in the aggregate, whichever is greater. If the failure is due to providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority imposing a tax authorized under this article in affidavit form attached to the return and remittance is made within ten days of due date, the return may be accepted exclusive of penalties and interest. In the case of a false or fraudulent return or of a failure to file a return where willful intent exists to defraud the governing authority of any tax due under an ordinance authorized by this article, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due shall be assessed.</p>

                <p>The governing authority of each county shall submit to the state auditor a copy of its regular annual audit not later than 180 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the audit was made. If an extension of time is granted to a county for the filing of the audit required by Code Section 36-81-7 or the correction of deficiencies in such an audit, then the same extension of time shall apply for purposes of this paragraph. The state auditor shall compare the amount of funds distributed to each county in the year of the audit against the amount of funds expended by the county in that year for the purposes authorized by this Code section. In the event the state auditor determines that the amount so expended in any year is less than the amount distributed, he shall certify the amount of the difference to the Office of the State Treasurer, which shall deduct and withhold the certified amount from the next funds to be distributed to the underexpending county under this Code section. In the event a county expending less than the amount distributed to it certifies at the time of the submission of its audit or within a reasonable time thereafter that it is accumulating the unexpended funds for a specified allowable purpose and submits proof of the deposit or investment of the funds, the county shall be deemed to have complied with this subsection, except that the amount of the unexpended funds shall be added to the amount of funds distributed to the county in the next succeeding year or years for the purpose of making the comparison and determination provided in this Code section. Upon the request of the Governor or the commissioner of transportation, the state auditor may audit the books and records of each county to verify the accuracy of the audits filed with him and to ensure that the expenditure of the funds has been made for the purposes intended.</p>

            <p>§ 48-16-1. Legislative findings, declarations, and intent
The General Assembly finds and declares that a public purpose is served by the waiver of tax penalties and criminal prosecution in return for the immediate reporting and payment of previously underreported, unreported, or unpaid tax liabilities.  The General Assembly further finds and declares that the benefits gained through this program include, among other things, increased collection of certain currently owed taxes, permanently bringing into the tax system taxpayers who have been evading payment of taxes and providing an opportunity for taxpayers to satisfy tax obligations before stepped-up tax enforcement programs take effect.  It is the intention of the General Assembly in enacting this chapter that the tax amnesty program provided under this chapter be a one-time occurrence which shall not be repeated in the future because taxpayers' expectations of any future amnesty programs could have a counterproductive effect on compliance under this chapter.

            <p>§ 48-16-3. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Accounts receivable" means an amount of state tax, penalty, or interest which has been recorded as due and entered in the account records or any ledger maintained in the department, or which a taxpayer should reasonably expect to become due as a direct or indirect result of any pending or completed audit or investigation, which a taxpayer knows is being conducted by any federal, state, or local taxing authority.

(2)  "Final, due, and owing" means an assessment which has become final and is owed to the state due to either the expiration of the taxpayer's appeal rights or, in the case of an assessment which has been appealed, either pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," or pursuant to Code Section 48-2-59, the rendition of the final order by the commissioner or by any court of this state. Assessments that have been appealed shall be final, due, and owing 15 days after the last unappealed or unappealable order sustaining the assessment or any part thereof has become final.  Assessments that have not been appealed shall be final, due, and owing 30 days after service of notice of assessment pursuant to Code Section 48-2-45.

(3)  "Taxpayer" means any individual, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation, receiver, trustee, guardian, executor, administrator, fiduciary, or any other entity of any kind subject to any tax set forth in this title or any person required to collect any such tax under this title.

              <p>As used in this Code section, the term "ruling" means a written determination that is issued to a person by the commissioner pursuant to regulations promulgated for that purpose, in response to such person's written inquiry about his or her status for tax purposes or the tax effects of acts or transactions, and is based on applying the tax statutes, regulations, or other legal authority to such person's specific set of facts. Such term thus does not include, for example, notices of proposed or final assessment or decisions thereon, decisions on claims for refund, decisions to accept or reject offers in compromise, voluntary disclosure or closing agreements, and responses to petitions or applications under Code sections permitting the commissioner to waive penalty or interest.</p>

              <p>The board created by this Code section shall be designated the State Board of Equalization. The chairman and administrative officer of the board shall be the commissioner. Each year, when the digest of assessments proposed by the commissioner is complete, the commissioner shall submit the digest to the State Board of Equalization which shall carefully examine the proposed assessments of each class of taxpayers or property and the digest of proposed assessments as a whole to determine that they are reasonably apportioned among the several tax jurisdictions and reasonably uniform with the values set on other classes of property throughout the state. If the board determines that the proposed assessed values of any one or more of the classes of taxpayers or property or the digest as a whole does not reasonably conform to the values set for other property throughout the state, it shall inquire as to the reason for the lack of conformity and shall adjust and equalize the same by either adding or subtracting a fixed percentage to the class of taxpayer, to the class of property, or to the digest as a whole, as the case may be.</p>

After final approval by the State Board of Equalization of the digest of proposed assessments made by the commissioner and after any adjustments by the board as authorized by this Code section are made, the commissioner shall notify within 30 days each taxpayer in writing of the proposed assessment of its property. At the same time, the commissioner shall notify in writing the board of tax assessors of such county, as outlined in Code Section 48-5-511, of the total proposed assessment of the property located within the county of taxpayers who are required to return their property to the commissioner. If any such taxpayer notifies the commissioner and the board of tax assessors in any such county of its intent to dispute a portion of the proposed assessment within 20 days after receipt of the notice, the county board of tax assessors shall include in the county digest only the undisputed amount of the assessment, and the taxpayer may challenge the commissioner's proposed assessment in an appeal filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County or with the Georgia Tax Tribunal in accordance with Chapter 13A of Title 50 within 30 days of receipt of the notice. In any such appeal to the superior court, the taxpayer shall have the right of discovery as provided in Chapter 11 of Title 9, the "Georgia Civil Practice Act." In any such appeal to the Georgia Tax Tribunal, discovery shall be as provided in Chapter 13A of Title 50, the "Georgia Tax Tribunal Act of 2012."

              <p>Any taxpayer who wishes to expedite the payment of a sales and use tax claim for refund may apply to the commissioner for such expedited refund; and as part of such application the taxpayer shall file a bond that is satisfactory to the commissioner as security for the repayment of such refund and any applicable tax, interest, penalties, fees, or costs in the event that the commissioner determines within the applicable statute of limitations that all or a portion of such refund was paid in error. The commissioner shall issue the refund within 30 days of the date of the posting of the approved bond. Any assessment of tax, interest, penalties, fees, or costs related to the payment of such refund claim shall be made within three years after the date that such refund was paid by the commissioner.</p>

                <p>As used in this subsection, the term:
(A)  "Disregard" means any careless, reckless, or intentional disregard.

(B)  "Excessive amount" means that portion of the claim for refund that exceeds the amount that is eligible for refund and for which there is no reasonable basis.

(C)  "Frivolously filed" means a sales and use tax claim for refund in which the amount claimed exceeds the amount eligible for refund by at least 50 percent.

(D)  "Negligence" includes any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of this title.(E)  "Reasonable basis" means a position that is reasonably based on one or more of the following authorities: applicable provisions of this title and other statutory provisions; proposed and adopted regulations construing such statutes; court cases; official opinions of the Attorney General; and letter rulings, policy statements, informational bulletins, and other administrative pronouncements published by the commissioner. Notwithstanding the preceding list of authorities, an authority shall not continue to be an authority to the extent it is overruled or modified, implicitly or explicitly, by a body with the power to overrule or modify the earlier authority.</p>

                <p>Any taxpayer who frivolously files a sales and use tax claim for refund shall be subject to a penalty of 20 percent of the excessive amount. No penalty shall be assessed pursuant to this subsection against any portion of an excessive amount for which a refund is claimed in good faith and the filing of which was not due to negligence or disregard of the law. The determination of whether a taxpayer acted in good faith shall be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances. Generally, the most important factor in such determination is the extent of the taxpayer's effort to assess the taxpayer's proper tax liability. Circumstances that may indicate good faith shall include an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances, including the experience, knowledge, and education of the taxpayer. An isolated computational or transcriptional error generally is not inconsistent with good faith.</p>

              <p>The commissioner may grant, upon written request, a reasonable extension of time for filing returns, declarations, or other documents required under state revenue laws whenever, in the reasonable exercise of such commissioner's judgment, a good cause for the extension exists. The commissioner shall keep a record of every extension granted and the reason for the extension. No extension or extensions, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, shall aggregate more than six months, nor shall any extension of time for filing returns, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, operate to delay the payment of a tax unless a bond satisfactory to the commissioner is posted. In no event shall the commissioner extend the time of filing returns which are required to be filed with the tax receiver or tax commissioner.</p>

            <p>§ 48-2-37. Preparation of delinquent returns
In any case in which any return, report, or other information is not filed or made available to the commissioner as required by law, the commissioner may proceed at the expense of the delinquent taxpayer to ascertain such information in any way which the commissioner reasonably considers proper or appropriate; and the commissioner is authorized to prepare, execute, and file such returns. Any return so made and filed by the commissioner or his agent shall be prima facie correct and sufficient for all legal purposes.

Such deemed failure to make the required filing shall also result in the forfeiture of the compensation of dealers for reporting and paying tax provided in Code Section 48-8-50 since such Code section provides such compensation only if such return is timely filed. The penalty imposed on the taxpayer for such failure shall be the greater of $25.00 for each such return or 5 percent of the tax due on each such return before application of any payments or credits. Such $25.00 penalty or 5 percent penalty amount shall be consistent with the penalty imposed on the failure to file a withholding tax return as provided in Code Section 48-7-126.</p>

            <p>§ 48-2-46. Procedures for protests
Any taxpayer may contest any proposed assessment or license fee made or determined by the commissioner by filing with the commissioner a written protest at any time within 30 days from the date of notice of the proposed assessment or license fee or within such other time limit as may be specified within the notice of proposed assessment or license fee, if a different time limit is specified.  All protests shall be prepared in the form and contain such information as the commissioner shall reasonably require and shall include a summary statement of the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies and his reasons for disputing the finding of the commissioner.  The filing of a written protest, a petition for redetermination of a deficiency, or a written request by the taxpayer for additional time for filing such a petition shall toll the period of limitations for making an assessment until the petition is denied by the commissioner or the request is withdrawn in writing by the taxpayer.  In the event the taxpayer desires a conference or hearing, the fact of such desire must be set out in the protest. The commissioner shall grant a conference before his officers or agents as he may designate at a time he shall specify and shall make such reasonable rules governing the conduct of conferences as he may deem proper.  The discretion given in this Code section to the commissioner shall be reasonably exercised on all occasions.

            <p>§ 48-2-48. Deficiency assessments; interest
If the commissioner ascertains that the return of any taxpayer (or dealer pursuant to Article 1 of Chapter 8 of this title) contains mistaken, false, or fraudulent statements or that it contains statements or omissions of data which are otherwise incorrect or misleading, and that as a result thereof improper or inadequate assessments of taxes have been made, the commissioner may determine and fix the amount of the taxes due from the taxpayer or dealer and shall proceed to collect the state tax due pursuant to the determination. In any case in which property assessments are made by the commissioner under the law for purposes of local taxation, the commissioner shall certify amounts of any property omitted from previous assessments to the proper local tax authorities for taxation in the local tax districts. All taxes collected under this Code section shall bear interest at the rate specified in Code Section 48-2-40, unless otherwise provided by law, from the date the commissioner advises the taxpayer in writing of the amount of the taxes due, until paid. The interest shall be assessed and collected as a part of the tax.

              <p>When the commissioner is required by law to certify to any county or municipal government of this state all or any part of an assessment or tax against any taxpayer and the taxpayer disputes the correctness of the assessment or tax as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner is directed to certify to the county and municipal government the value of the property of the taxpayer or the tax admitted by him in his return to be due, or both such value and such tax due. After a final determination of the balance of the assessment or tax in dispute, the commissioner shall make a supplemental certification to the county and municipal government of the amount of the balance of the assessment or tax as finally determined. It shall be the duty of the taxpayer to pay as required by law any taxes assessed by the state, county, or municipal governments, both upon the original value as shown in his return and upon the supplemental value determined as provided in this chapter.

                <p>The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative may use garnishment to collect any tax, fee, license, penalty, interest, or collection costs due the state which are imposed by this title or which the commissioner or the department is responsible for collecting under any other law. Garnishment may be issued by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative against any person whom the commissioner believes to be indebted to the defendant or who has property, money, or effects in such person's hands belonging to the defendant. The summons of garnishment shall be served by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative, shall be served at least 15 days before the sitting of the court to which the summons is made returnable, and shall be returned to either the superior court or the state court of the county in which the garnishee is served. The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative shall enter on the execution the names of the persons garnished and shall return the execution to the appropriate court. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law regarding garnishments in other cases when judgment has been obtained or execution issued. In addition to any other methods of service, the summons of garnishment may be served by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative to the garnishee by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested. Either the return receipt indicating receipt by the garnishee or the envelope bearing the official notification from the United States Postal Service of the garnishee's refusal to accept delivery of such registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which the garnishment is pending. If statutory overnight delivery was accomplished through a commercial firm as provided under paragraph</p>

              <p>of Code Section 9-10-12, the return receipt indicating receipt by the garnishee or the envelope bearing the official notification of such commercial firm of the garnishee's refusal to accept delivery shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which garnishment is pending. If a garnishee refuses to accept service of a summons of garnishment by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, the summons of garnishment shall be served by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative under any other method of lawful service and the garnishee shall be personally liable to the commissioner for a sum equal to the actual costs incurred to serve the summons of garnishment. This liability shall be paid upon notice and demand by the commissioner or the commissioner's delegate and shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as other taxes administered by the commissioner.</p>

                <p>A levy upon an account in or with a financial institution shall be a constructive levy and shall be effective at the time of personal service upon the financial institution as evidenced by an entry of service upon the levy by the commissioner or his authorized representative, or by an acknowledgment of service made by a proper official of the financial institution indicating the date and time of service.  The commissioner or his authorized representative may, in lieu of personal service or service by mail, serve a levy upon a financial institution, and a financial institution may acknowledge service of a levy by telephonic facsimile transmission or by other means of instantaneous electronic transmission.  The financial institution shall remit to the commissioner or his authorized representative as provided in this subsection not later than 15 days after personal service or acknowledgment of service by mail or facsimile or other instantaneous electronic transmission. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a financial institution receiving a levy shall remit the full amount of its depositor's accounts that are subject to levy, to the extent of the amount claimed upon the levy, without deduction; provided, however, nothing contained in this subsection shall be deemed to diminish the right of a financial institution to exercise its right of setoff.</p>

Advertisements of sales shall designate the time, place, and manner of the sale, shall give a reasonable description of the property to be sold, shall be posted in three public places in the county, and shall be inserted at least one time in the newspaper in which sheriff's sales in the county are advertised. The commissioner may prescribe by regulation methods for providing notice of sale in addition to the provisions of this subparagraph.
(B)  The commissioner or his or her authorized representative may conduct the sale of such personal property via public auction, public Internet auction, or via sealed bids. If the sale is conducted via public auction, the sale shall be held between the hours of 10:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. eastern standard time or eastern daylight time, whichever is applicable. The sale shall be conducted within the county in which the property levied on is situated, except that if it appears to the commissioner that substantially higher bids may be obtained for the property if the sale is held at a place outside such county, he may order that the sale be held in such other place. If the location of the sale is in a county other than the county in which the levy was made, notice of the sale as required by this Code section shall be made in both counties. The commissioner may prescribe by regulation the manner or other conditions for sales by public auction, public Internet auction, or sealed bids, including whether payment in full is required at the time of acceptance of the bid, under what circumstances the sale may be adjourned, and whether, and under what circumstances, multiple items of property may be sold separately, in groups, or in the aggregate.

The preparation of a substantial portion of a return or claim for refund shall be treated as if it were the preparation of such return or claim for refund. A person shall not be considered a tax return preparer merely because the person does any of the following:
(A)  Furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance;

(B)  Prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer, or an officer or employee of the employer, by whom the person is regularly and continuously employed;

(C)  Prepares as a fiduciary a return or claim for refund for any person; or

(D)  Prepares a claim for refund for a taxpayer in response to a notice of proposed assessment issued to the taxpayer.</p>

            <p>§ 48-3-3.1. Immediate payment or bond where person or property may leave jurisdiction or property's value may be prejudiced
If the tax collector or tax commissioner reasonably finds that a taxpayer gives evidence of intention to leave the state, to remove his or her property from the state, to conceal himself or herself or his or her property, to discontinue business, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or render wholly or partly ineffective proceedings to compute, assess, or collect any ad valorem tax, whereby it becomes advisable that such proceedings be brought without delay, the tax collector or tax commissioner shall give notice of such finding and demand immediate payment of such tax as may be due.  The tax collector or tax commissioner may immediately make an assessment based on the most recently accepted assessment or on a tax assessor's assisted assessment and may proceed under the assessment to collect the tax or require the taxpayer to file with him or her a bond satisfactory to the tax collector or tax commissioner as security for payment of the tax.  Taxes assessed under this Code section for any tax year for which millage rates applicable to the property have not been established at the time of the assessment shall be based upon the millage rates in effect for the immediately preceding year.

When action is required to be taken by the commissioner, it shall be sufficient compliance with this chapter if the action is done by his deputy or his attorney.

When action is required of the Secretary of State, it shall be sufficient compliance with this chapter if the action is done by his deputy.

            <p>§ 48-4-2. Assessment and disposition of unreturned property
When property which has not actually been returned by anyone is assessed for taxes, the tax collector or tax commissioner shall issue an execution against the property as soon as it is assessed for the amount due and costs. The sheriff shall advertise the property for sale in the newspaper in which sheriff's sales are advertised once a week for four weeks before the day of sale. If the taxes are not paid by the day of the sale, the property shall be sold, but only if renting or hiring the property will not bring the requisite amount. Surplus from a sale after the payment of the taxes and costs shall be paid over to the county governing authority as a part of the educational fund, together with a statement of the property and account of sales, subject to the claim of the true owner within four years.

            <p>§ 48-4-43. Effect of redemption
When property has been redeemed, the effect of the redemption shall be to put the title conveyed by the tax sale back into the defendant in fi. fa., subject to all liens existing at the time of the tax sale. If the redemption has been made by any creditor of the defendant or by any person having any interest in the property, the amount expended by the creditor or person interested shall constitute a first lien on the property and, if the quitclaim deed provided for in Code Section 48-4-44 is recorded as required by law, shall be repaid prior to any other claims upon the property.

            <p>§ 48-4-75. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds that the nonpayment of ad valorem taxes by property owners effectively shifts a greater tax burden to property owners willing and able to pay their share of such taxes, that the failure to pay ad valorem taxes creates a significant barrier to neighborhood and urban revitalization, that significant tax delinquency creates barriers to marketability of the property, and that nonjudicial tax foreclosure procedures are inefficient, lengthy, and commonly result in title to real property which is neither marketable nor insurable. In addition, the General Assembly finds that tax delinquency in many instances results in properties which present health and safety hazards to the public. Consequently, the General Assembly further finds that the alternative to nonjudicial tax foreclosure procedures authorized by this article is an effective means of eliminating health and safety hazards by putting certain tax delinquent properties back on the tax rolls and into productive use.

            <p>§ 48-4-101. Findings and declarationsThe General Assembly finds and declares that:
(1)  Georgia's communities are important to the social and economic vitality of this state. Whether urban, suburban, or rural, many communities are struggling to cope with dilapidated, abandoned, and tax delinquent properties;

(2)  Citizens of Georgia are affected adversely by dilapidated, abandoned, and tax delinquent properties, including properties that have been abandoned due to mortgage foreclosure;

(3)  Dilapidated, abandoned, and tax delinquent properties impose significant costs on neighborhoods and communities by lowering property values, increasing fire and police protection costs, decreasing tax revenues, and undermining community cohesion;

(4)  There is an overriding public need to confront the problems caused by dilapidated, abandoned, and tax delinquent properties, and to return properties which are in nonrevenue-generating, nontax-producing status to an effective utilization status in order to provide affordable housing, new industry, and jobs for the citizens of this state through the creation of new tools that enable communities to turn abandoned spaces into vibrant places; and

(5)  Land banks are one of the tools that can be utilized by communities to facilitate the return of dilapidated, abandoned, and tax delinquent properties to productive use.

            <p>§ 48-5-2. (For effective date, see note.) DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(.1)  "Arm's length, bona fide sale" means a transaction which has occurred in good faith without fraud or deceit carried out by unrelated or unaffiliated parties, as by a willing buyer and a willing seller, each acting in his or her own self-interest, including but not limited to a distress sale, short sale, bank sale, or sale at public auction.

                <p>"Current use value" of bona fide residential transitional property means the amount a knowledgeable buyer would pay for the property with the intention of continuing the property in its existing use and in an arm's length, bona fide sale.  The tax assessor shall consider the following criteria, as applicable, in determining the current use value of bona fide residential transitional property:
(A)  The current use of such property;

(B)  Annual productivity; and

(C)  Sales data of comparable real property with and for the same existing use.</p>

                <p>"Fair market value of property" means the amount a knowledgeable buyer would pay for the property and a willing seller would accept for the property at an arm's length, bona fide sale. The income approach, if data are available, shall be utilized in determining the fair market value of income-producing property, and, if actual income and expense data are voluntarily supplied by the property owner, such data shall be considered in such determination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the transaction amount of the most recent arm's length, bona fide sale in any year shall be the maximum allowable fair market value for the next taxable year. With respect to the valuation of equipment, machinery, and fixtures when no ready market exists for the sale of the equipment, machinery, and fixtures, fair market value may be determined by resorting to any reasonable, relevant, and useful information available, including, but not limited to, the original cost of the property, any depreciation or obsolescence, and any increase in value by reason of inflation.  Each tax assessor shall have access to any public records of the taxpayer for the purpose of discovering such information.
(A)  In determining the fair market value of a going business where its continued operation is reasonably anticipated, the tax assessor may value the equipment, machinery, and fixtures which are the property of the business as a whole where appropriate to reflect the accurate fair market value.(B)  The tax assessor shall apply the following criteria in determining the fair market value of real property:</p>

(I)  In establishing the value of any property subject to rent restrictions under the sales comparison approach, any income tax credits described in division (vi) of this subparagraph that are attributable to a property may be considered in determining the fair market value of the property, provided that the tax assessor uses comparable sales of property which, at the time of the comparable sale, had unused income tax credits that were transferred in an arm's length, bona fide sale.

(II)  In establishing the value of any property subject to rent restrictions under the income approach, any income tax credits described in division (vi) of this subparagraph that are attributable to property may be considered in determining the fair market value of the property, provided that such income tax credits generate actual income to the record holder of title to the property; and

(viii)  Any other existing factors provided by law or by rule and regulation of the commissioner deemed pertinent in arriving at fair market value.

This final fair market value of the forest land shall be used in the calculation of local assistance grants. If local assistance grants have been granted to either a county, a county board of education, or a municipality based on the 2008 fair market value of forest land and subsequently the fair market value of such forest land is reduced on an appeal, then the county or the municipality shall reimburse the state, within 12 months unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the difference between local assistance grants paid to the county or municipality and the amount which would have been due based on the final fair market value of the forest land. Such 2008 valuation may increase from one taxable year to the next by a rate equal to the percentage change in the price index for gross output of state and local government from the prior year to the current year as defined by the National Income and Product Accounts and determined by the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis and indicated by the Price Index for Government Consumption Expenditures and General Government Gross Output (Table 3.10.4).

              <p>Property which is subject to preferential assessment and which is subject to a covenant under this Code section may be changed from such covenant and placed in a covenant for bona fide conservation use under Code Section 48-5-7.4 if such property meets all of the requirements and conditions specified in Code Section 48-5-7.4.  Any such change shall terminate the covenant under this Code section, shall not constitute a breach of the covenant under this Code section, and shall require the establishment of a new covenant period under Code Section 48-5-7.4.

              <p>At such time as the property ceases to be eligible for preferential assessment or when any ten-year covenant period expires and the property does not qualify for further preferential assessment, the owner of the property shall file an application for release of preferential treatment with the county board of tax assessors who shall approve the release upon verification that all taxes and penalties with respect to the property have been satisfied. After the application for release has been approved by the board of tax assessors, the board shall file the release in the office of the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the original covenant was filed. The clerk of the superior court shall file and index such release in the real property records maintained in the clerk's office. No fee shall be paid to the clerk of the superior court for recording such release. The commissioner shall by regulation provide uniform release forms.

              <p>Standing timber shall be assessed for ad valorem taxation only once and such assessment shall be made following its harvest or sale as provided for in this Code section.  Such timber shall be subject to ad valorem taxation notwithstanding the fact that the underlying land is exempt from taxation, unless such taxation is prohibited by federal law or treaty.  Such timber shall be assessed at 100 percent of its fair market value and shall be taxed on a levy made by each respective taxing jurisdiction according to such 100 percent fair market value.  Such assessment shall be made in the county where the timber was grown and shall be taxable by that county and any other taxing jurisdiction therein in which the timber was grown.</p>

                <p>Where standing timber is sold, in an arm's length, bona fide sale, by timber deed, contract, lease, agreement, or otherwise to be harvested within a three-year period after the date of the sale and for a lump sum price, so much of said timber as will be harvested within three years shall be assessed for taxation as of the date of the sale. The fair market value of such timber for purposes of ad valorem taxation shall be the lump sum price paid by the purchaser in the arm's length, bona fide sale. Any timber described in any sale instrument which is not harvested within three years after the date of the sale shall later be assessed for taxation following its future harvest or sale. Ad valorem taxes shall be payable by the seller and shall be calculated by multiplying the 100 percent fair market value of the timber times the millage rate levied by the taxing authority on tangible property for the previous calendar year. Immediately upon receipt by the seller of the purchase price, the seller shall remit to the purchaser the amount of ad valorem tax due on the sale, in the form of a negotiable instrument payable to the tax collector or tax commissioner. Such negotiable instrument shall be remitted by the purchaser to the tax collector or tax commissioner not later than five days after receipt of the tax from the seller. A purchaser failing to make such remittance shall be personally liable for the tax. With said remittance, the purchaser shall present to the board of tax assessors and to the tax collector or tax commissioner a report of the sale showing the lump sum sales price of the standing timber, the date of sale, the addresses of the seller and purchaser, and the location of the standing timber in the county. The tax collector or tax commissioner shall collect from the purchaser the seller's negotiable instrument in payment of the tax; and a receipt showing payment of the tax shall promptly be delivered by the tax collector or tax commissioner to the seller.</p>

The certificate shall be signed by the tax collector or tax commissioner or his deputy. The purchaser may then present the instrument together with the certificate to the clerk of superior court of the county or counties in which the standing timber is located, who shall then file the instrument for record.  The ad valorem tax levied under this subsection on lump sum sales of standing timber shall be paid to the tax collector or tax commissioner prior to and as a prerequisite to the filing for record of the instrument with the clerk of superior court, and the clerk shall not be permitted to file the instrument for record unless the instrument discloses on its face the proper certificate showing that the tax has been paid; and the certificate shall be recorded with the instrument.</p>

The remaining one-half of the taxes shall be due and payable on October 1 of each year and shall become delinquent if not paid by November 15 of each year. A penalty not to exceed 5 percent of the amount of each installment shall be added to each installment that is not paid before the installment becomes delinquent. Intangible taxes in one installment shall become due on October 1 of each year and shall become delinquent if not paid by December 31. A penalty not to exceed 5 percent of the amount of intangible taxes due shall be added to any installment that is not paid before it becomes delinquent. All taxes remaining unpaid as of the close of business on December 31 of each year shall bear interest at the rate specified in Code Section 48-2-40, but in no event shall an interest payment for delinquent taxes be less than $1.00. The tax collectors shall issue executions for delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest against each delinquent taxpayer in their respective counties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the governing authority of any county subject to this subsection may change the tax due dates provided in this subsection if the county's tax digest is not approved pursuant to Code Section 48-5-271 before July 1 of any year.</p>

The owner of any real property located in this state, and the transferee of every owner who acquires title to real property within this state between the date on which the tax lien on the property vests and the date on which the tax evidenced by the tax lien shall become due and payable, shall have the right to pay the taxes assessed against any one or more lots, tracts, or parcels of the real property: (1) by paying the amount of tax assessed against such lot, tract, or parcel if the property was separately returned by the owner or, in the case of a transfer, by the transferor of the property; or (2) if the property was not separately returned, by paying that percentage of the total tax assessed which the value of the property sought to be released bears to the value of all the property returned by the owner of such property as of the date on which the tax lien vested. The officials charged with the collection of taxes for this state or any subdivision of this state including, but not limited to, municipalities and counties, and any transferee of a tax lien shall accept payment of the taxes assessed against one or more lots, tracts, or parcels of real property upon tender by the owner of such property, including any transferee of the real property who has obtained title to the property between the time when the lien vested and the time on which the taxes are payable, and shall execute a release as to the property without regard to whether or not the taxes assessed against any other property, real or personal, of the owner, the transferee of the real property, or the transferor of the owner have been paid. The official or transferee of the tax lien accepting the payment and releasing the property shall be paid a fee of $2.00 for issuing the receipt and release. No such official or transferee of the tax lien shall be required to release any one or more tracts of real property after a fi. fa. has been recorded on the general execution docket in the county where the property is located without first receiving the entire amount of past due taxes as reflected in the fi. fa. No such official or transferee shall be required to release the last or only remaining lot, parcel, or tract of real property until all personal property taxes owed by the owner have been paid.

"NOTICE OF PROPERTY TAX INCREASE 

The (name of recommending authority or levying authority) has tentatively adopted a millage rate which will require an increase in property taxes by (percentage increase over roll-back rate) percent.

All concerned citizens are invited to the public hearing on this tax increase to be held at (place of meeting) on (date and time) .

Times and places of additional public hearings on this tax increase are at (place of meeting) on (date and time) .

This tentative increase will result in a millage rate of (proposed millage rate) mills, an increase of (millage rate increase above the roll-back rate) mills. Without this tentative tax increase, the millage rate will be no more than (roll-back millage rate) mills. The proposed tax increase for a home with a fair market value of (average home value from previous year's digest rounded to the nearest $25,000.00) is approximately $ (increase) and the proposed tax increase for nonhomestead property with a fair market value of (average nonhomestead property value from previous year's digest rounded to nearest $25,000.00) is approximately $ (increase)."

            <p>§ 48-5-340. Purpose of article
It is the purpose and intent of this article to establish a procedure for use by the commissioner to equalize county property tax digests between counties and within counties so as to require county boards of tax assessors to make adjustments in the valuation of property to ensure uniformity and equity. The commissioner shall continue to examine the digest and exercise his responsibility to bring about property valuations that are reasonably uniform and equalized throughout the state.

                <p>Upon receipt of an appeal of a conditional approval order of the commissioner where the specific penalty and the withholding of state grants to the county provided by Code Section 48-5-346 shall otherwise be imposed, the commissioner shall be authorized to enter into an agreement with the county specifying a detailed plan in the form required by the commissioner to ensure that the deficiencies in the digest will be corrected on or before the time of submission of the digest for the next succeeding digest review year.  As a part of such agreement the commissioner shall be authorized to defer the imposition of all or part of the specific penalty and the withholding of state grants. Such deferral shall be predicated upon the county's detailed plans of correction being followed and where such a deferral has been agreed to by the commissioner and the county, the amounts deferred shall be permanently waived by the commissioner provided the agreement is faithfully completed by the county.  In the event, however, the county only partially completes the agreement with the commissioner, the commissioner may, at his option, still allow all or a reduced amount of the specific penalty or withholding of funds to be waived if, in his judgment, the county's deviation from the original agreement was not unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>

Every municipality may levy and collect municipal taxes upon all taxable property within the limits of the municipality to provide for financial assistance to its development authority or a joint county and municipal development authority for the purpose of developing trade, commerce, industry, and employment opportunities. The tax levied for the purposes provided in this Code section shall not exceed three mills per dollar upon the assessed value of the property; provided, however, the authorization contained in this Code section to levy and collect such tax shall not be deemed to be exclusive and shall not prevent any municipality from exercising any additional power granted to it pursuant to any constitutional amendment, whether general or special, to levy any ad valorem tax for the purpose of providing financial assistance to any municipal or joint county and municipal development authority. The exceptions to the three mill per dollar tax limitation contained in the proviso of the preceding sentence shall not be construed so as to affect any action pending in court on February 20, 1984.

The summons of garnishment shall be served by the finance officer, other tax collector, sheriff, or any constable of the county in which the garnishee resides at least 15 days before the sitting of the superior court or city court of the county in which the municipality is located and shall be returned to such appropriate court.</p>

                <p>It is the duty of every public utility, in addition to the facts otherwise required to be included in its returns to the commissioner, to show in its return the fair market value of its property in each of the school districts in which its property is located. For the purpose of enabling the public utility to show in its returns the fair market value of its property in each school district, each county superintendent of schools shall furnish to each public utility information as to the boundaries of each school district in which the public utility may have property so as to enable the public utility to determine the amount of its property in each school district. The county superintendent of schools shall also furnish similar information whenever the boundaries of any school district are changed.</p>

The commissioner shall fix the proposed assessment of the utility's property for school purposes at the same time and in the same manner as he is authorized by law to fix the proposed assessment of the property for ordinary county purposes.

              <p>The commissioner shall use the same procedures for collecting school taxes of railroad equipment companies, insofar as they can be applied, as are provided for the collection of county taxes due from railroad equipment companies under Code Section 48-5-519. When it becomes necessary for the commissioner to issue a tax fi. fa. for county purposes as well as for school purposes, he may include the school tax in the fi. fa. and shall specify separately in the assessment and tax execution the amount of the county taxes for ordinary purposes and the amount for school purposes so that the tax commissioner or tax collector, after collecting the taxes, can pay over each tax to the proper person authorized by law to receive the tax. Should the taxpayer desire to contest the taxability of his property, as provided under this subsection, he may do so by bringing an action for equitable relief in the Superior Court of Fulton County.

Each class or species of property shall be separately named and valued as far as practicable and shall be taxed like all other property under the laws of this state. The returns shall also include the capital stock, net annual profits, gross receipts, business, or income (gross, annual, net, or any other kind) for which the public utility is subject to taxation by the laws of this state. Each parcel of real estate included in the return shall be identified by its street address. If the commissioner is unable to locate the property by its street address after exercising due diligence in attempting to locate the property, then the commissioner may request more information from the taxpayer to help identify the exact location of the property. Such additional information may include a map or parcel identification information.</p>

Such proportions shall be calculated pursuant to the most recently determined fair market valuations of the property as determined by the county board of tax assessors.

(3)  "Long-term note secured by real estate" means any note representing credits secured by real estate by means of mortgages, deeds to secure debt, purchase money deeds to secure debt, bonds for title, or any other form of security instrument, when any part of the principal of the note falls due more than three years from the date of the note or from the date of any instrument executed to secure the note and conveying or creating a lien or encumbrance on real estate for such purpose.

(4)  "Short-term note secured by real estate" means any note which would be a long-term note secured by real estate were it not for the fact that the whole of the principal of the note falls due within three years from the date of the note or from the date of any instrument executed to secure the note.

            <p>§ 48-6-61. Filing instruments securing long-term notes; procedure; intangible recording tax; rate; maximum tax
Every holder of a long-term note secured by real estate shall, within 90 days from the date of the instrument executed to secure the note, record the security instrument in the county in which is located the real estate conveyed or encumbered or upon which a lien is created to secure the note and shall present, prior to presenting the instrument to the clerk of superior court for recording, the security instrument to the collecting officer of the county in which the real estate is located. The collecting officer shall determine from the face of the security instrument the date of execution of the instrument, the maturity date of the note, and the principal amount of the note. There is imposed on each instrument an intangible recording tax at the rate of $1.50 for each $500.00 or fraction thereof of the face amount of the note secured by the recording of the security instrument. The collecting officer shall collect the tax due on the security instrument from the holder of the instrument; provided, however, the holder may pass on the amount of such tax to the borrower or mortgagor but the amount of such tax passed to the borrower or mortgagor shall not be considered or treated as part of any finance charge imposed by the holder in connection with the loan transaction. If the security instrument reflects an amount greater than the principal amount of the note and, at the time the security instrument is presented for recording, the holder of the note also presents for recording with the security instrument said holder's sworn statement itemizing the principal amount of the note and the other charges included within the amount shown on the face of the security instrument, the collecting officer shall determine the principal amount of the note from the sworn statement. The maximum amount of any intangible recording tax payable as provided in this Code section with respect to any single note shall be $25,000.00.

                <p>Upon payment of the correct tax as disclosed from the information recited on the face of the security instrument, the collecting officer shall enter upon or attach to the security instrument a certification that the intangible recording tax as provided by Code Section 48-6-61 has been paid, the date, and the amount of the tax. The certificate shall be signed by the collecting officer or said officer's deputy.  The holder of a security instrument upon which the tax has been paid as provided by this article may then present the security instrument together with the certificate to the clerk of superior court of the county in which the real property is located, who may then file the security instrument for record.  It is the intention of the General Assembly that the intangible tax levied by Code Section 48-6-61 shall be paid to the collecting officer prior to and as a prerequisite to the filing for record of the real property instrument securing the note with the clerk of superior court and that the clerk shall not be permitted to file the instrument for record unless the security instrument discloses on its face the principal amount of the note, the date executed, the due date, and the certificate of the collecting officer or said officer's deputy showing that the tax has been paid on the instrument.  Presentation for recording of a sworn statement as to the principal amount of the note, as authorized in Code Section 48-6-61, shall suffice for purposes of permitting the filing of a security instrument which is in compliance with this paragraph other than for the fact that the security instrument does not disclose the principal amount of the note.</p>

            <p>§ 48-6-66. Showing correct amount and due date on instruments encumbering or conveying real estate
Every instrument conveying, encumbering, or creating a lien upon real estate shall set forth in words and figures the correct amount of the note secured by the instrument and the date upon which the note falls due. When the note falls due within three years from the date of the note or from the date of any instrument executed to secure the note, a statement of that fact in lieu of specifying the date upon which the note falls due may be made in the security instrument and shall constitute sufficient compliance with this Code section. The inclusion in the instrument of a provision that the instrument secures all other indebtedness then existing or thereafter incurred shall not require the setting forth in the instrument of existing indebtedness for loans not made on the security of the instrument.

The commissioner upon his own motion or upon the written request of one or more holders of instruments securing notes secured by real property shall render publicly and in writing his determination of whether the intangible recording tax provided in this article is payable with respect to a particularly described real property instrument or class of real property instruments or modifications of such instruments. The determination may be in the form of administrative regulations if applicable to a class of real property instruments. A copy of all such determinations shall be retained in the files of the department as a permanent and public record. Nonpayment of the tax provided for in this article, with respect to a real property instrument filed for record, in reliance upon a determination rendered by the commissioner pursuant to this Code section shall not constitute a bar, as provided in Code Section 48-6-77, to the collection of the indebtedness secured by any such instrument.

            <p>§ 48-6-73. Reports and distributions by collecting officer; failure to distribute as breach of duty and bond; commissions; long-term notes not entered on property tax digest
Each collecting officer shall make a report to the commissioner by the tenth day of each month on forms prescribed by the commissioner of all sums collected and remitted under this article for the preceding month. The collecting officer shall retain 6 percent of the tax collected as compensation for said officer's services in collecting the tax. All such taxes shall be deemed to have been collected by the collecting officer in said officer's official capacity. Failure to collect and distribute the tax as provided by law shall constitute a breach of the official duty and of the official bond of the collecting officer. In each county in which the collecting officer is on a salary, the 6 percent commission allowed by this Code section shall be paid into the county treasury and shall become county property. The long-term notes secured by real property upon which this tax is based shall not be placed upon the property tax digest prepared and maintained by the tax receiver. It is the intention of the General Assembly that the 6 percent commission permitted under this article for the collection and distribution of this tax by the collecting officer shall be the only compensation permitted to any collecting officer with respect to this tax.

              <p>Failure to pay the tax levied by this article shall constitute a bar to the collection by any action, foreclosure, the exercise of any power of sale, or otherwise of the indebtedness secured by any instrument required by this article to be recorded, whether the instrument is held by an original party to the instrument or by a transferee. However, failure to pay the tax levied by this article shall not affect or discharge the indebtedness and other obligations secured by such instrument or the debtor's liability on account thereof and, subject to the bar, such instrument shall continue to secure the indebtedness and other obligations secured thereby and shall continue to encumber the collateral described therein. The bar may be removed by the payment of the required tax, plus interest at the rate specified in Code Section 48-2-40 from the time the tax was due, plus a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of the tax, after which the process to collect the indebtedness, including foreclosure, may proceed as if no bar ever existed. However, if an instrument required to be recorded fails to reflect on its face that the tax levied by this article is due and after a foreclosure has taken place it is discovered that the instrument securing the indebtedness is in fact subject to the tax, any deed given pursuant to the foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure shall be imperfected but may be perfected by the payment of the required tax, plus interest at the rate specified in Code Section 48-2-40 from the time the tax was due plus a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of the tax. Once the tax, interest, and penalty as required in this subsection have been paid, the perfection of the deed will revert back to the date of the deed, and the deed shall retain its priority over any and all intervening liens or conveyances except those conveyances and liens made or created by the grantee, its successors, and assigns named in the foreclosure deed or deed in lieu of foreclosure.

The remaining 80 percent of Georgia gross receipts shall be attributable to the institution's other Georgia offices, pro rata according to the number of such offices. The term "office" as used in this Code section means a place of business of a depository financial institution at which the institution accepts deposits but shall not include unmanned automatic teller machines, point-of-sale terminals, or other similar unmanned electronic facilities at which deposits may be accepted. If there are fewer than five offices in addition to the principal Georgia office, the amount of gross receipts attributable to each such office shall be determined by dividing the Georgia gross receipts by the aggregate number of such offices.</p>

            <p>§ 48-6-97. Taxation of credit unions; legislative intent to tax state and federally chartered credit unions equally
Except as otherwise provided by law, credit unions organized under the provisions of Chapter 1 of Title 7, the "Financial Institutions Code of Georgia," shall be subject to all forms of state and local government taxation authorized by the Congress of the United States for the taxation of federally chartered credit unions on January 1, 1984. It is the intent of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia that credit unions organized under the laws of this state and credit unions organized under the laws of the United States and domiciled within this state be subject to the same degree of taxation whether by the state or any of its political subdivisions in which such credit union maintains a place of business. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that in the event the Congress of the United States should change the manner in which federally chartered credit unions may be taxed by state and local governments, then to the extent that state legislative authority is not preempted by the Congress, state-chartered credit unions and federally chartered credit unions operating in this state shall be taxed to the same extent and in the same manner as state-chartered savings and loan associations operating in this state.

            <p>§ 48-6-98. Legislative intent to tax all depository financial institutions equally; interim special tax limitation for savings and loan associationsIt is the intent of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia that depository financial institutions shall be taxed in the same manner and to the same extent for purposes of state taxation. It is the further intent of the General Assembly of Georgia that depository financial institutions shall be taxed in the same manner and to the same extent by the individual political subdivisions in which they have an office or place of business; provided, however, that the following distinctions shall be made to recognize differences between banks and savings and loan associations:
(1)  Any appropriate distinctions made elsewhere in this chapter; and

(2)  For a period of three years from January 1, 1984, the aggregate gross receipts taxes payable by any savings and loan association under the provisions of this chapter shall not be in excess of an amount that would be raised by a current ad valorem tax imposed upon the net worth of said association. As used in this chapter, the term "net worth" means all surplus, undivided profits, and reserves exclusive of any reserve required by any federal or state statute or regulation in force as of January 1, 1980, which statute or regulation was applicable to such federal or state-chartered association, and minus the fair market value of all real estate or equity therein owned by the association.

                <p>Georgia taxable income shall be adjusted as provided in Code Section 48-7-28.3.(10.1)  Net operating losses for corporations shall be treated as follows:
(A)  For any taxable year in which the taxpayer takes a federal net operating loss deduction on its federal income tax return, the amount of such deduction shall be added back to federal taxable income, and Georgia taxable net income for such taxable year shall be computed from the taxpayer's federal taxable income as so adjusted. There shall be allowed as a separate deduction from Georgia taxable net income so computed an amount equal to the aggregate of the Georgia net operating loss carryovers to such year, plus the Georgia net operating loss carrybacks to such year if such carrybacks are allowed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Any limitations included in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on the amount of net operating loss that can be used in a taxable year shall be applied for purposes of this Code section; provided, however, that such limitations, including, but not limited to, the 80 percent limitation, shall be applied to Georgia taxable net income;

(B)  The Georgia net operating loss for such taxable year shall be computed by making the adjustments to federal taxable income required by this article and in the case of corporations doing business both within and outside Georgia, by apportioning and allocating to Georgia, as provided in Code Section 48-7-31, only the amount of the loss attributable to operations within Georgia. The term "Georgia net operating loss" shall mean the loss computed as provided in this paragraph. In the event the net Georgia adjustments completely offset a federal net operating loss, there shall be no Georgia net operating loss for the taxable year, and any excess of net Georgia adjustments over the federal net operating loss shall constitute Georgia taxable net income after any such excess has been allocated and apportioned to Georgia as provided in Code Section 48-7-31.

For purposes of this subsection, a resident limited partnership or similar nontaxable entity shall not include a family limited partnership or similar nontaxable entity the majority interest of which is owned by one or more natural or naturalized citizens related to each other within the fourth degree of reckoning according to the laws of descent and distribution. This subsection shall not apply to a person that participates in the management of the resident limited partnership or other similar nontaxable entity or that is engaged in a unitary business with another person that participates in the management of the resident limited partnership or other similar nontaxable entity.

                <p>of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if the organization makes payments of death benefits as a result of the death of a member of the organization, and if payments have been made by the organization for at least five years prior to January 1, 1977, the payments shall be deductible from the unrelated business income tax which might be owed by the organization. The payment of such death benefits shall not operate to generate a rebate or a refund. If the amount of death benefits paid within the taxable year exceeds the unrelated business income tax owed for the same taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of five years.

Shareholders of a federal Subchapter "S" corporation which is not recognized for Georgia purposes may make an adjustment to federal adjusted gross income in order to avoid double taxation on this type of income. Adjustments shall not be allowed unless tax was actually paid by such corporation.

A resident individual who has an established business in another state, has investment in property having a taxable situs in another state, or engages in employment in another state may deduct from the tax due upon the entire net income of the resident individual the tax paid upon the net income of the business, investment, or employment in another state when the business, investment, or employment is in a state that levies a tax upon net income. In no case shall the credit permitted under this Code section exceed the tax which would be payable to this state upon a like amount of taxable income.

The denial of a petition under this subparagraph shall be appealable pursuant to Code Section 48-2-59. Such an appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the date of the commissioner's notice of denial;(2.1)  (A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, all terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meaning as such terms are defined in 49 U.S.C. Section 1301 and the United States Department of Transportation's Uniform System of Accounts and Reports for Large Certificated Air Carriers, 14 C.F.R. Part 241, as now or hereafter amended.(B)  Where the net business income of the corporation is derived principally from transporting passengers or cargo in revenue flight, the portion of the net income therefrom attributable to property owned or business done within this state shall be taken to be the portion arrived at by application of the following three-factor formula:</p>

              <p>Revenue air miles factor. The revenue air miles factor is a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the total, for each flight stage which originates or terminates in this state, of revenue passenger miles by aircraft type flown in this state and revenue cargo ton miles by aircraft type flown in this state and the denominator of which shall be equal to the total, for all flight stages flown everywhere, of total revenue passenger miles by aircraft type and total revenue cargo ton miles by aircraft type;

(ii)  Tons handled factor. The tons handled factor is a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the total of revenue passenger tons by aircraft type handled in this state and revenue cargo tons by aircraft type handled in this state and the denominator of which shall be equal to the total of revenue passenger tons by aircraft type flown everywhere and revenue cargo tons by aircraft type flown everywhere. For purposes of this division, the term "handled" means the product of 60 percent multiplied by the revenue passenger tons flown on each flight stage which originates in this state or 60 percent multiplied by the revenue cargo tons flown on each flight stage which originates in this state;

(iii)  Originating revenue factor. The originating revenue factor is a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the total of passenger and cargo revenue by aircraft type which is attributable to this state and the denominator of which shall be the total of passenger and cargo revenue by aircraft type everywhere. For purposes of this division, passenger or cargo revenue which is attributable to this state shall be equal to the product of passenger or cargo revenue everywhere by aircraft type multiplied by the ratio of revenue passenger miles or revenue cargo ton miles in this state to total revenue passenger miles everywhere or total revenue cargo ton miles everywhere for each aircraft type as separately determined in division</p>

              <p>of this subparagraph. If records of total passenger revenue everywhere by aircraft type or total cargo revenue everywhere by aircraft type are not maintained, then for purposes of this division, total passenger revenue everywhere for all aircraft types or total cargo revenue everywhere for all aircraft types shall be allocated to each aircraft type based on the ratio of total revenue passenger miles everywhere for that aircraft type to all aircraft types or total revenue cargo ton miles everywhere for that aircraft type to all aircraft types;(iv)  The revenue air miles factor, the tons handled factor, and the originating revenue factor shall be separately determined and an apportionment fraction shall be calculated using the following formula:
(I)  The revenue air miles factor shall represent 25 percent of the fraction;

(II)  The tons handled factor shall represent 25 percent of the fraction; and(III)  The originating revenue factor shall represent 50 percent of the fraction.
The net income of the corporation shall be apportioned to this state according to such average fraction;(2.2)  (A) As used in this paragraph, the term:</p>

(ii)  "Customer" means the banks and institutions to whom credit card data processing and related services are provided.(iii)  "Gross receipts factor" means a fraction, the numerator of which is the total gross receipts from the taxpayer's customers during the tax period, if the principal office of the customer's credit card operation is in this state or if the principal office of the taxpayer's customer is in this state, and the denominator of which is the total gross receipts from all of the taxpayer's customers during the tax period.
(B)  Where more than 60 percent of the total gross receipts of a corporation are derived from the provision of credit card data processing and related services to banks and other institutions, the portion of the net income attributable to business done in this state shall be determined by multiplying the corporation's net income by the gross receipts factor in division (iii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph;</p>

If any such corporation keeps its records of operating revenues and operating expenses on a state basis in accordance with the standard classification of accounts prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission and in a manner which includes in net income for the state the effect of all intrastate and interstate business applicable to the state, the state records may be used by the taxpayer under the supervision of the commissioner in reporting the net taxable income within the state.</p>

            <p>§ 48-7-35. Application for permission to use other method of allocation by corporation or nonresident; contents; effect of failure to receive notice of rejection
If any corporation or nonresident shows by any method of allocation other than the processes or formulas prescribed by this chapter that another method reflects more clearly the income attributable to the trade or business within this state, application for permission to base its return upon the other method shall be considered by the commissioner. The application shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail with full explanations the method the taxpayer believes will more clearly reflect its income from business within the state. If the commissioner concludes that the method of allocation and apportionment submitted by the taxpayer is in fact inapplicable and inequitable, he shall reject the application and shall so notify the taxpayer. Failure to receive the commissioner's notice shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for not filing the return on its due date utilizing the allocation and apportionment method prescribed by this chapter.

Each employee whose employer receives credit against such business enterprise's quarterly or monthly payment under Code Section 48-7-103 shall receive credit against his or her income tax liability under Code Section 48-7-20 for the corresponding taxable year for the full amount which would be credited against such liability prior to the application of the credit provided for in this paragraph.

The additional credit shall be claimed in the first taxable year in which the new full-time employee job is created. The number of new full-time employee jobs shall be determined by comparing the monthly average number of full-time employees subject to Georgia income tax withholding for the taxable year with the corresponding period of the prior taxable year. In tier 1 counties, those existing business enterprises that increase employment by five or more shall be eligible for the credit.

In tier 3 counties, only those existing business enterprises that increase employment by 15 or more shall be eligible for the credit. In tier 4 counties, only those existing business enterprises that increase employment by 25 or more shall be eligible for the credit.

              <p>Business enterprises in areas designated by the commissioner of community affairs as less developed areas shall be allowed a job tax credit for taxes imposed under this article equal to $3,500.00 annually per eligible new full-time employee job for five years beginning with the first taxable year in which the new full-time employee job is created and for the four immediately succeeding taxable years; provided, however, that where the amount of such credit exceeds a business enterprise's liability for such taxes in a taxable year, the excess may be taken as a credit against such business enterprise's quarterly or monthly payment under Code Section 48-7-103 but not to exceed in any one taxable year $3,500.00 for each new full-time employee job when aggregated with the credit applied against taxes under this article. Each employee whose employer receives credit against such business enterprise's quarterly or monthly payment under Code Section 48-7-103 shall receive credit against his or her income tax liability under Code Section 48-7-20 for the corresponding taxable year for the full amount which would be credited against such liability prior to the application of the credit provided for in this subsection. Credits against quarterly or monthly payments under Code Section 48-7-103 and credits against liability under Code Section 48-7-20 established by this subsection shall not constitute income to the taxpayer. The number of new full-time employee jobs shall be determined by comparing the monthly average number of full-time employees subject to Georgia income tax withholding for the taxable year with the corresponding period of the prior taxable year. Only those business enterprises that increase employment by five or more in a less developed area shall be eligible for the credit; provided, however, that within areas of pervasive poverty as designated under paragraphs</p>

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary of Code Sections 48-7-40 and 48-7-40.1, business enterprises may make a one-time election to calculate new full-time jobs on a calendar year rather than a taxable year basis for all jobs created during calendar year 1994 and thereafter as compared against the preceding calendar year. Such one-time election may be made by claiming job tax credits in connection with any 1995 state income tax return or amended return that is filed after April 29, 1997. Such election will not change the taxable year of the business enterprise.

              <p>Only a taxpayer that completes the creation of a qualified project in a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2017, shall be eligible to begin a subsequent seven-year job creation period for the qualified project, provided that the taxpayer creates 50 or more new quality jobs, at the site or sites of a qualified project or the facility or facilities resulting therefrom, above its single previous high yearly average number of new quality jobs during any prior seven-year job creation period. A subsequent seven-year job creation period is subject to all the requirements of this Code section. A taxpayer must notify the commissioner of their intent to begin a subsequent seven-year job creation period. The commissioner shall provide by regulation the time in which such notification shall occur. New quality jobs generated under previous seven-year job creation periods shall continue to be eligible for the credit as provided by this Code section. No new quality jobs may be generated under previous periods of eligibility after a subsequent period of eligibility has begun. New quality jobs created in a subsequent seven-year job creation period shall not be counted as additional new quality jobs under a previous seven-year job creation period; instead those new quality jobs shall count toward the subsequent period. For purposes of determining the number of new quality jobs in a particular year that are attributable to each seven-year job creation period, the taxpayer shall begin with the first seven-year job creation period and then attribute the remainder to each subsequent seven-year job creation period from the oldest to the newest. Such attributions shall be made up to the single high yearly average number of new quality jobs for each seven-year job creation period. A taxpayer may create more than one subsequent seven-year job creation period.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary of Code Sections 48-7-40 and 48-7-40.1, business enterprises may apply to the commissioner to make a one-time election to calculate new full-time jobs on a calendar year rather than a taxable year basis for all jobs created during calendar year 2001. Such one-time election may be made by claiming job tax credits calculated on the basis set forth in Code Sections 48-7-40 and 48-7-40.1 in connection with any 2002 state income tax return filed after the effective date of this Code section. Such election will not change the taxable year of the business enterprise.

Credits against quarterly or monthly payments under Code Section 48-7-103 and credits against liability under Code Section 48-7-20 established by this subsection shall not constitute income to the taxpayer.</p>

(A)  A description of the qualified postproduction activities;

(B)  A certification that the postproduction company maintains a business location physically located in this state;

(C)  A certification that the postproduction company expended a total aggregate payroll of $250,000.00 or more for employees working within this state during the taxable year of the postproduction company;

(D)  In the initial year in which the postproduction company claims the credit granted in this Code section only, information demonstrating that the qualified postproduction expenditures equal or exceed $500,000.00 during such year;

(E)  A detailed listing of the employee names, social security numbers, and Georgia wages when salaries are included in the qualified postproduction expenditures;

(F)  The amount of tax credit claimed for the taxable year;

(G)  Any tax credit previously taken by the postproduction company against Georgia income tax liabilities or the postproduction company's quarterly or monthly payments under Code Section 48-7-103;

(H)  The amount of tax credit carried over from prior years;

(I)  The amount of tax credit utilized by the postproduction company in the current taxable year; and(J)  The amount of tax credit to be carried over to subsequent tax years.
The postproduction company shall file a copy of the schedule with the Department of Economic Development within 30 days after the schedule is filed with its income tax return;</p>

(A)  May be carried forward for five years from the close of the taxable year in which the investment occurred; or(B)  May be taken as a credit against such postproduction company's quarterly or monthly payment under Code Section 48-7-103. Each employee whose employer receives credit against such postproduction company's quarterly or monthly payment under Code Section 48-7-103 shall receive credit against his or her income tax liability under Code Section 48-7-20 for the corresponding taxable year for the full amount which would be credited against such liability prior to the application of the credit provided for in this subparagraph. Credits against quarterly or monthly payments under Code Section 48-7-103 and credits against liability under Code Section 48-7-20 established by this subparagraph shall not constitute income to the postproduction company.

(A)  Such postproduction company may make only a single transfer or sale of tax credits earned in a taxable year; however, the transfer or sale may involve one or more transferees;

(B)  Such postproduction company shall submit to the Department of Economic Development and to the Department of Revenue a written notification of any transfer or sale of tax credits within 30 days after the transfer or sale of such tax credits. The notification shall include such postproduction company's tax credit balance prior to transfer, the credit certificate number, the remaining balance after transfer, all tax identification numbers for each transferee, the date of transfer, the amount transferred, and any other information required by the Department of Economic Development or the Department of Revenue;

(C)  Failure to comply with this paragraph shall result in the disallowance of the tax credit until the postproduction company is in full compliance;

(D)  The transfer or sale of this tax credit does not extend the time in which such tax credit can be used. The carry-forward period for a tax credit that is transferred or sold shall begin on the date on which the tax credit was originally earned;

(E)  A transferee shall have only such rights to claim and use the tax credit that was available to such postproduction company at the time of the transfer, except for the use of the credit in subparagraph (B) of paragraph</p>

(F)  Any postproduction company claiming, transferring, or selling the tax credit shall be required to reimburse the Department of Revenue for any department initiated audits relating to the tax credit. This subparagraph shall not apply to routine tax audits of a taxpayer that may include the review of the credit provided in this Code section.</p>

                <p>Assessments of additional Georgia income tax, interest, and penalties arising from final federal adjustments. The commissioner will assess additional Georgia income tax, interest, and penalties arising from final federal adjustments as if it is a tax imposed by this chapter unless a different treatment is provided by this subsection. Since partnership adjustments are determined at the audited partnership level, any assessment issued to partners shall not be appealable by the partner.

If a partnership, tiered partner, or other partner files with the commissioner a federal adjustments report as required within the period specified in this subsection reporting all final federal adjustments, the commissioner may assess any taxes, including on-behalf taxes, interest, and penalties arising from those final federal adjustments if the commissioner issues a notice of assessment to the partnership, tiered partner, or partner, on or before the later of:</p>

(A)  Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the partnership, tiered partner, or other partner and the commissioner, any adjustments by the commissioner after the expiration of the time provided in Code Section 48-7-82 or by the partnership, tiered partners, or other partners made after the expiration of the time provided in Code Section 48-2-35, are limited to changes to the partnership's, tiered partner's, or other partner's Georgia income tax liability arising directly or indirectly from final federal adjustments.

(B)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this subsection for the assessment of Georgia income tax, both the commissioner and the person subject to assessment have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the agreed upon period. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the previously agreed upon period and the commissioner is authorized in any such agreement to extend similarly the period within which a claim for refund may be filed; provided, however, that the time periods provided in this subsection may be extended automatically by 60 days for an audited partnership which has 10,000 or more direct partners or a tiered partner which has 10,000 or more partners that hold an interest directly in such tiered partner, provided that such audited partnership or tiered partner attaches a statement to its federal adjustments report specifying that it has elected such automatic extension.</p>

              <p>No penalty due to late filing shall be incurred by a taxpayer if the taxpayer attaches to his return a copy of an approved extension of time within which to file his federal income tax return which has been granted by the Internal Revenue Service and also files his state return within the period of time specified in the extension. In such instances, the taxpayer need not apply to the commissioner for an extension of time within which to file his state return.

            <p>§ 48-7-80. Time and place of payment of tax on basis of calendar or fiscal year
The total amount of tax imposed by this chapter on taxpayers other than corporations shall be paid to the commissioner on or before April 15 following the close of the calendar year. If the return of a taxpayer other than a corporation is made on the basis of a fiscal year, the tax shall be paid to the commissioner on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the fiscal year. However, in the case a taxpayer's return is allowed to be filed at a later date, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as it existed on or after January 1, 2003, because the taxpayer has electronically filed returns, the date of payment shall be extended without interest and penalty to the date the return is allowed to be filed pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as it existed on or after January 1, 2003. The total amount of tax imposed by this chapter on corporations other than Georgia Subchapter "S" corporations shall be paid to the commissioner on or before April 15, following the close of the calendar year. If the return of a corporation other than a Georgia Subchapter "S" corporation is made on the basis of a fiscal year, the tax shall be paid to the commissioner on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the fiscal year. The total amount of tax imposed by this chapter on Georgia Subchapter "S" corporations shall be paid to the commissioner on or before March 15, following the close of the calendar year. If the return of a Georgia Subchapter "S" corporation is made on the basis of a fiscal year, the tax shall be paid to the commissioner on or before the fifteenth day of the third month following the close of the fiscal year.

Whenever any corporation has been dissolved or the assets of the corporation for any reason have passed entirely from the control of the corporation into the possession of its former stockholders or other persons without the payment of income taxes due the state, the commissioner shall have the right to bring action against any or all persons possessing the assets for the collection of any income taxes that may be due the state up to the value of the assets.

The commissioner in his reasonable discretion shall be the sole judge as to when this Code section shall apply.

In the event any employer is delinquent in payment of the tax imposed by this article, the commissioner may give notice of the amount of the delinquency by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to all persons having in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the employer and to all persons owing any debts to the employer at the time of receipt by them of the notice. In lieu of registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, the notice may be served and the recipient may acknowledge service thereof by telephonic facsimile transmission or by other means of instantaneous electronic transmission. Thereafter, no person so notified shall transfer or make any other disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts until the commissioner has consented to a transfer or disposition or until 30 days have elapsed after receipt of the notice. Each person so notified must advise the commissioner, within five days after receipt of the notice, of any and all credits, other personal property, or debts in such person's possession, under such person's control, or owing by such person as provided in this Code section.</p>

This subsection shall not apply to a claim for refund filed with, but separately from, a final return under general law and shall not affect the period of limitations allowed by general law applicable to a claim for refund when filed separately from a final return.</p>

              <p>Limitation on refund or credit.  No refund or credit shall be allowed unless the employee attaches to and files with his final income tax return a copy of the employer's receipt as provided for in Code Section 48-7-105 for the amount of tax deducted and withheld from his wages for that taxable year. If an employee submits satisfactory proof that his employer deducted and withheld taxes from his wages and that the employer failed or refused to furnish the employee with the prescribed receipt, the proof so furnished may be taken to establish a credit or refund under this Code section.</p>

              <p>Setoffs.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a refund or a portion thereof may be transferred to a claimant agency to set off a debt due and owing to the claimant agency as provided in Article 7 of this chapter. When any action pursuant to Article 7 of this chapter is taken, that article shall govern all aspects of right and entitlement to refunds covered thereunder. Funds transferred to claimant agencies shall not bear interest. If there is a final determination that the taxpayer alleged to be a debtor is entitled to receive all or part of the funds transferred to a claimant agency, the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled shall bear interest at the rate provided in Code Section 48-2-35 beginning 30 days after the final determination.

            <p>§ 48-7-113. Employer refunds and credits; procedure; claim for abatement of overassessment
If more than the correct amount of tax, penalty, or interest is paid to the commissioner by an employer, the employer may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may take credit for the overpayment against the tax reported on any quarterly return which the employer subsequently files. A refund or credit of the overpayment, however, shall be made only to the extent that the amount of overpayment exceeds the tax actually withheld and the penalty and interest on the tax. If more than the correct amount of tax, penalty, or interest is assessed and is not paid to the commissioner, the employer against whom the assessment is made may file a claim for abatement of the overassessment.

              <p>To the extent that the estimated tax credit, together with other credits allowed by law, is in excess of the taxpayer's income tax liability for a taxable year as shown on a final return filed by the taxpayer for that year, the overpayment shall be considered as taxes erroneously paid and shall be credited or refunded as provided in this subsection. The overpayment shall be credited to the taxpayer's estimated income tax liability for the succeeding taxable year unless the taxpayer claims a refund for the overpayment. The commissioner may consider any final return showing an overpayment as a claim for refund per se. An overpayment shall bear no interest if credit is given for the overpayment. Amounts refunded as overpayments shall bear interest at the rate provided in Code Section 48-2-35 but only after 90 days from the filing date of the final return showing the overpayment or 90 days from the due date of the final return, whichever is later.

            <p>§ 48-7-160. Purposes
The purpose of this article is to establish a policy and to provide a system whereby all claimant agencies and courts of this state in conjunction with the department shall cooperate in identifying debtors who owe money to the state through its various claimant agencies or courts and who qualify for refunds from the department. It is also the purpose of this article to establish procedures for setting off against any such refund the sum of any debt owed to the claimant agencies or courts. It is the intent of the General Assembly that this article be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.

On or after July 1, 1995, the distribution of proceeds of the tax as specified in the certificate shall be based upon, but not be limited to, the following criteria:</p>

Notwithstanding the fact that a certificate shall not contain an execution in behalf of one or more qualified municipalities within the special district, if the combined total of the populations of all such absent municipalities is less than one-half of the aggregate population of all qualified municipalities located within the special district, the submitting political subdivisions shall, in behalf of the absent municipalities, specify a percentage of that portion of the remaining proceeds which each such municipality shall receive, which percentage shall not be less than that proportion which each absent municipality's population bears to the total population of all qualified municipalities within the special district multiplied by that portion of the remaining proceeds which are received by all qualified municipalities within the special district.  For the purpose of determining the population of the absent municipalities, only that portion of the population of each such municipality which is located within the special district shall be computed. No certificate may contain a total of specified percentages in excess of 100 percent.  The certificate shall be filed with the commissioner by March 1, 1980, for those special districts in which the tax authorized by this article is being levied on January 1, 1980.  For all other special districts in which the tax shall be imposed subsequent to January 1, 1980, the certificate shall be filed with the commissioner within 60 days after the tax is imposed within the district.  The commissioner shall continue to distribute the proceeds of the tax as otherwise provided in this Code section until the first day of the next calendar year following the month in which the commissioner receives a certificate as provided in this Code section, which certificate shall provide other percentages upon which the commissioner shall make the distribution to the pol</p>

              <p>of this Code section shall be filed with and received by the commissioner. The General Assembly recognizes that the requirement for government services is not always in direct correlation with population. Although a new distribution certificate is required within a time certain of the decennial census, this requirement is not meant to convey an intent by the General Assembly that population as a criterion should be more heavily weighted than other criteria. It is the express intent of the General Assembly in requiring such renegotiation that eligible political subdivisions shall analyze local service delivery responsibilities and the existing allocation of proceeds made available to such governments under the provisions of this article and make rational the allocation of such resources to meet such service delivery responsibilities. Political subdivisions in their renegotiation of such distributions shall at a minimum consider the criteria specified in subsection</p>

            <p>§ 48-8-90. Crediting of tax paid by purchaser in another tax jurisdiction; payment of difference between lesser similar tax payment and tax imposed by article; proof of payment; limitation on credit
Where a local sales or use tax has been paid with respect to tangible personal property by the purchaser either in another local tax jurisdiction within the state or in a tax jurisdiction outside the state, the tax may be credited against the tax authorized to be imposed by this article upon the same property. If the amount of sales or use tax so paid is less than the amount of the use tax due under this article, the purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid in the other tax jurisdiction and the amount due under this article. The commissioner may require such proof of payment in another local tax jurisdiction as he deems necessary and proper. No credit shall be granted, however, against the tax imposed under this article for tax paid in another jurisdiction if the tax paid in such other jurisdiction is used to obtain a credit against any other local sales and use tax levied in the special district or in the county which is conterminous with the special district; and taxes so paid in another jurisdiction shall be credited first against the tax levied under this article and then against the tax levied under Article 3 of this chapter, if applicable.

              <p>As a condition precedent for authority to levy the tax or to collect any proceeds from the tax authorized by this article for the year following the initial year in which it is levied and for all subsequent years, the county whose geographical boundary is conterminous with that of the special district and each qualified municipality therein receiving any proceeds of the tax shall adjust annually the millage rate for ad valorem taxation of tangible property within such political subdivisions as provided in this subsection. The governing authority of each such political subdivision shall compute the millage rate necessary to produce revenue from taxation of tangible property in its respective political subdivision which, when combined with other revenues reasonably expected to be received by the political subdivision during the year other than revenues derived from the tax imposed pursuant to this article, would provide revenues sufficient to defray the expenses of the political subdivision for the year. The millage rate so ascertained shall then be reduced by a millage rate which, if levied against the tangible property within the political subdivision, would produce an amount equal to the distribution of the proceeds of the tax imposed by this article which were received by the political subdivision during the preceding year. The tax bill of each ad valorem taxpayer in the political subdivision shall show in a prominent manner the millage rate first ascertained as provided in this subsection and shall show such millage rate reduced by the millage rate required to raise an amount of revenue equal to the distribution of the proceeds of the tax imposed by this article during the previous year. The remainder shall be the millage rate upon which each taxpayer's bill shall be based.

Upon receipt of the resolution, it shall be the duty of the election superintendent to issue the call for an election for the purpose of submitting the question of discontinuing the levy of the tax to the voters of the special district for approval or rejection. The election superintendent shall issue the call and shall conduct the election on a date and in the manner authorized under Code Section 21-2-540. The election superintendent shall cause the date and purpose of the election to be published once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date of the election in the official organ of the county.

It shall be the duty of the election superintendent to hold and conduct such elections under the same rules and regulations as govern special elections. It shall be such superintendent's further duty to canvass the returns, declare and certify the result of the election, and certify the result to the Secretary of State and to the commissioner.

              <p>A certified service provider is the agent of a seller, with whom the certified service provider has contracted, for the collection and remittance of sales and use taxes. As the seller's agent, the certified service provider is liable for sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it processes for the seller except as set out in this Code section. A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to the state for sales or use taxes due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud. In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service provider. A seller is subject to audit for transactions not processed by the certified service provider. The member states acting jointly may perform a system check of the seller and review the seller's procedures to determine if the certified service provider's system is functioning properly and the extent to which the seller's transactions are being processed by the certified service provider.</p>

If such debt is incurred through the execution of a promissory note or notes or other instrument or instruments, no validation proceedings shall be necessary and such debt shall be subject to Code Sections 36-80-10 through 36-80-14 except as specifically provided otherwise in this article. In either event, such general obligation debt shall be payable first from the separate account in which are placed the proceeds received by the municipality from the tax authorized by this article. Such general obligation debt shall, however, constitute a pledge of the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the municipality; and any liability on such debt which is not satisfied from the proceeds of the tax authorized by this article shall be satisfied from the general funds of the municipality.

            <p>§ 48-8-207. Payment of tax on personal property in another local tax jurisdiction; collection of difference
Where a local sales or use tax has been paid with respect to tangible personal property by the purchaser either in another local tax jurisdiction within the state or in a tax jurisdiction outside the state, the tax may be credited against the tax authorized to be imposed by this article upon the same property. If the amount of sales or use tax so paid is less than the amount of the use tax due under this article, the purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid in the other tax jurisdiction and the amount due under this article. The commissioner may require such proof of payment in another local tax jurisdiction as the commissioner deems necessary and proper. No credit shall be granted, however, against the tax imposed under this article for tax paid in another jurisdiction if the tax paid in such other jurisdiction is used to obtain a credit against any other local sales and use tax levied in the municipality or in a special district which includes the municipality; and taxes so paid in another jurisdiction shall be credited first against the tax levied under Article 2 of this chapter, if applicable, then against the tax levied under Article 3 of this chapter, if applicable, then against the tax levied under Article 2A of this chapter, if applicable, and then against the tax levied under this article.

            <p>§ 48-8-272. Purpose of article; legislative findings
The General Assembly finds and declares that the general welfare and material well-being of the citizens of this state depend in large measure upon the development of tourism in the state; that it is in the best interest of this state to induce the creation of tourism attractions or expansion of existing tourism attractions within this state in order to advance the public purposes of relieving unemployment by preserving and creating jobs that would not exist if not for the sales and use tax refund offered by the State of Georgia to approved companies and preserving and creating sources of tax revenues for the support of public services provided by the state; that the purposes to be accomplished under the provisions of this article are proper governmental and public purposes for which public moneys may be expended; and that the inducement of the creation of tourism attraction projects is of paramount importance to the economy of the state, mandating that the provisions of this article are to be liberally construed and applied in order to advance public purposes.

              <p>per gallon on distributors who sell or use diesel fuel within this state. It is the intention of the General Assembly that the legal incidence of the tax be imposed upon the distributor.(1.1)  (A) Beginning on July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the amount of this excise tax per gallon on distributors shall be automatically adjusted on an annual basis in accordance with this paragraph.
(B)  Using 2014 as a base year, the department shall determine the average miles per gallon of all new vehicles registered in this state pursuant to Code Section 48-5C-1 using the average of combined miles per gallon published in the United States Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide. Beginning on July 1, 2016, and each year thereafter, the department shall calculate the average miles per gallon of all new vehicles registered in this state in the previous year. The excise tax rate shall be multiplied by the percentage increase or decrease in fuel efficiency from the previous year, and the resulting increase or decrease shall be added to the excise tax rate to determine the preliminary excise tax rate.

(C)  Once the preliminary excise tax rate is established, it shall be multiplied by the annual percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index. The resulting calculation shall be added to the preliminary excise tax rate, and the result of such calculation shall be the new excise tax rate for motor fuels for the next calendar year. The Consumer Price Index shall no longer be used after July 1, 2022.</p>

                <p>Retail dealers and persons using gasoline for agricultural purposes are entitled to a refund of motor fuel taxes as provided by this Code section. The right to receive any refund shall not be assignable and any assignment shall be void and of no effect. No payment shall be made by the commissioner to any person other than the original person entitled to the refund. To enable the commissioner to make the refunds as authorized by this Code section, the Office of the State Treasurer, under warrants drawn by the Governor, shall remit to the commissioner from funds appropriated by law an amount equivalent to the refunds. Before the Governor issues a warrant for the funds, he shall require the commissioner to certify the name of each applicant and the amount to which each applicant is entitled.</p>

The commissioner shall prescribe a simplified method of filing the proper records of taxable diesel fuel purchases used exclusively for agricultural field use vehicles which shall serve as the basis for the refund. The refund shall be computed by multiplying the total annual volume of taxable diesel fuel purchases used exclusively for agricultural field use vehicles, times the combined total of the current state motor fuel tax and the second motor fuel tax, with the resulting product further multiplied by a factor of .90. The commissioner shall adopt such additional rules and regulations as may be necessary to provide for the proper administration of this paragraph.</p>

            <p>§ 48-9-18. Operation without distributor's license; assessment of penalty in lieu of taxes
If any person required by this article to hold an uncanceled distributor's license engages in business in this state as a distributor without such a license, thereby incurring a tax liability under this article which, but for the fact that such person was unlicensed, would not have been incurred, the commissioner may in his discretion waive such tax liability, including any applicable penalties and interest thereon, and assess in lieu thereof a penalty under this Code section. Such penalty shall be equal to 10 percent of the tax liability which, but for the fact that such person was unlicensed, would not have been incurred, but shall not be less than $100.00 for each monthly tax period involved.  No taxes shall be waived under this Code section where the commissioner determines that such person failed to become properly licensed prior to operating as a distributor in this state, that such person knew or should have known of the requirement that he be licensed prior to so operating, and that such person failed to remit to the state such taxes under this article as are due from licensed distributors.

For the purposes of making payment of taxes and filing reports pursuant to this article, the year is divided into four quarters of three consecutive months each. The first quarter of the year shall consist of the months of January, February, and March. The road tax shall be paid by each motor carrier to the commissioner on or before the last day of the month immediately following the quarter with respect to which tax liability under this article accrues and shall be calculated upon the amount of motor fuel used by the motor carrier in its operations within this state during the quarter ending on the last day of the preceding month. The amount of motor fuel used in the operations of any motor carrier within this state shall be the proportion of the total amount of motor fuel used in its entire operations within and outside this state which the total number of miles traveled within this state bears to the total number of miles traveled within and outside this state.

            <p>§ 48-9-35. Credit against road tax for payment of motor fuel tax; evidence of payments; subsequent application of credit exceeding amount of road tax; limit
Every motor carrier subject to the road tax shall be entitled to a credit on the tax equivalent to the amount of motor fuel tax imposed by Article 1 of this chapter on all motor fuel purchased by the motor carrier during the quarter within this state for use in operations either within or outside this state when the motor fuel tax imposed by this state has been paid by the motor carrier. Evidence of the payments of the motor fuel tax in the form required by the commissioner shall be furnished by each motor carrier claiming the credit allowed. When the amount of the credit to which any motor carrier is entitled for any quarter exceeds the amount of the road tax for which the carrier is liable for same quarter, the excess may be allowed pursuant to regulations promulgated by the commissioner as a credit on the road tax for which the motor carrier would be otherwise liable for the subsequent quarter or quarters. Allowed credits may be carried forward and utilized no later than the succeeding two calendar years.
