          <p>Every unit of the organized militia is and shall be deemed to be a society within the meaning of Code Section 14-5-49, and Code Sections 14-5-46 through 14-5-48 shall apply to such society; provided, however, the commissioned officer or officers of the unit shall constitute the trustee or trustees of such society; and provided, further, should any unit have assigned more than three commissioned officers, the senior three shall constitute the trustees of the society. The name or names of the trustee or trustees shall be certified under the hand of the commanding officer of the unit and the certificate shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county wherein lies any property held in trust by the trustee or trustees. Any vacancy which may happen in the trust shall be filled by the officer appointed to fill the vacancy in the unit. When any such vacancy shall be filled, the same shall be certified under the hand of the commanding officer of the unit, which certificate shall state the name of the officer to fill the vacancy and the name of the officer whom he succeeds unless the officer fills an original vacancy in the unit; and the certificate shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county wherein lies property held in trust by the trustees. Any such society referred to in this Code section may take and hold by devise or bequest the title to real and personal property for its uses and purposes as a military organization in addition to its right and power to take the same by deed of conveyance and, subject to the uses and purposes contained in the deed of conveyance or devise or bequest, may mortgage, sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the same. Should any such unit be deactivated, disbanded, moved from the locality where it acquired the title to the property, called or ordered into the active service of the United States, or by orders of competent authority cease to function as a unit of the organized militia, the title to any such property held by the unit shall vest in trust in the adjutant general, or other officer nearest corresponding to the adjutant general should that office not be in existence, to be conveyed by him to the trustees of some other unit of the organized militia nearest like the predecessor unit, as determined by him, in trust for military purposes.</p>
