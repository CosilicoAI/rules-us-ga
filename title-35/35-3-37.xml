          <p>The center does not receive notice from the arresting law enforcement agency that the offense has been referred to the prosecuting attorney or transferred to another law enforcement or prosecutorial agency of this state, any other state or a foreign nation, or any political subdivision thereof for prosecution and the following period of time has elapsed from the date of the arrest of such individual:</p>
          <p>If the offense is a misdemeanor or a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature, two years;</p>
          <p>If the offense is a felony, other than a serious violent felony or a felony sexual offense specified in Code Section 17-3-2.1 involving a victim under 16 years of age, four years; or</p>
          <p>If the offense is a serious violent felony or a felony sexual offense specified in Code Section 17-3-2.1 involving a victim under 16 years of age, seven years.</p>
          <p>The offense was referred to the prosecuting attorney but was later dismissed;</p>
          <p>The grand jury returned two no bills; or</p>
          <p>The grand jury returned one no bill and the applicable time period set forth in division (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph has expired; and</p>
          <p>After indictment or accusation:</p>
          <p>Except as provided in subsection (i) of this Code section, all charged offenses were dismissed, nolle prossed, or reduced to a violation of a local ordinance;</p>
          <p>The individual was sentenced in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) or subsection (c) of Code Section 16-13-2, and either the court ordered restriction upon sentencing as permitted in Code Section 16-13-2 or the individual successfully completed the terms and conditions of his or her probation;</p>
          <p>The individual pleaded guilty to or was found guilty of a violation of paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (a) of Code Section 3-3-23 and was sentenced in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of Code Section 3-3-23.1, and either the court ordered restriction upon sentencing as permitted in Code Section 3-3-23.1 or the individual successfully completed the terms and conditions of his or her probation;</p>

          <p>The individual was acquitted of all of the charged offenses by a judge or jury unless, within ten days of the verdict, the prosecuting attorney demonstrates to the trial court through clear and convincing evidence that the harm otherwise resulting to the individual is clearly outweighed by the public interest in the criminal history record information being publicly available because either:</p>
          <p>The prosecuting attorney was barred from introducing material evidence against the individual on legal grounds, including, without limitation, the granting of a motion to suppress or motion in limine; or</p>
          <p>The individual has been formally charged with the same or similar offense within the previous five years.</p>
          <p>After the filing of an indictment or accusation, an individual's criminal history record information shall not be restricted if:</p>
