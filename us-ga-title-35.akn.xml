            <p>§ 35-10-2. Declaration of public purpose
It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any municipal or county police department or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the municipal or county police department or a member thereof. Furthermore, the municipal or county police department, which has provided quality law enforcement services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the department, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any municipal or county police department's name or any term used to identify the department or its members without the expressed permission of the local governing authority. The provisions of this chapter are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.

          <content>
            <p>§ 35-2-84. Procedure for seeking permission to use department nomenclature or symbols
Any person wishing permission to use either department nomenclature or symbols may request such permission in writing to the commissioner. The commissioner shall serve notice on the requesting party within 15 calendar days after receipt of the request of his or her decision on whether the person may use the nomenclature or the symbol. If the commissioner does not respond within the 15 day time period, then the request is presumed to have been denied. The grant of permission under Code Section 35-2-82 or 35-2-83 shall be in the discretion of the commissioner under such conditions as the commissioner may impose. If the commissioner denies such request and the person making such request reasonably believes that the commissioner has acted in bad faith or based on an illegal motive, then the person may, within 15 days after the person's request was denied or granted on limited terms, file an appeal with the Board of Public Safety. The matter will then be considered before the board, but the burden will be with the person making the request to show that the request was improperly denied or limited.

            <p>§ 35-3-104. Procedures for seeking permission to use bureau nomenclature or symbols
Any person wishing permission to use either bureau nomenclature or symbols may request such permission in writing to the director. The director shall serve notice on the requesting party within 15 calendar days after receipt of the request of his or her decision on whether the person may use the nomenclature or the symbol. If the director does not respond within the 15 day time period, then the request is presumed to have been denied. The grant of permission under Code Section 35-3-102 or 35-3-103 shall be in the discretion of the director under such conditions as the director may impose. If the director denies such request and the person making such request reasonably believes that the director has acted in bad faith or based on an illegal motive, then the person may, within 15 days after the person's request was denied or granted on limited terms, file an appeal with the Board of Public Safety. The matter will then be considered before the board, but the burden will be with the person making the request to show that the request was improperly denied or limited.

            <p>§ 35-3-162. Procedure for analysis and storage of blood sample; use of remainder of sample not subjected to analysis; confidentiality of results
Whether or not the results of an analysis are to be included in the data bank, the bureau shall conduct the DNA analysis in accordance with procedures adopted by the bureau to determine identification characteristics specific to the individual whose sample is being analyzed. The director or his or her designated representative shall complete and maintain on file a form indicating the name of the person whose sample is to be analyzed, the date and by whom the sample was received and examined, and a statement that the seal on the container containing the sample had not been broken or otherwise tampered with. The remainder of a sample submitted for analysis and inclusion in the data bank pursuant to Code Section 35-3-160 may be divided, if possible, labeled as provided for the original sample, and securely stored by the bureau in accordance with specific procedures of the bureau to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the samples. All or part of the remainder of that sample may be used only to create a statistical data base provided no identifying information on the individual whose sample is being analyzed is included or for retesting by the bureau to validate or update the original analysis. A report of the results of a DNA analysis conducted by the bureau as authorized, including the identifying information, shall be made and maintained at the bureau. Except as specifically provided in this Code section and Code Section 35-3-163, the results of the analysis shall be securely stored and shall remain confidential.

              <p>Persons employed or appointed by any agency, organ, or department of this state or a subdivision or municipality thereof authorized to use speed detection devices shall be required to be certified by the council as qualified speed detection device operators. Each person operating radar speed or laser detection devices shall satisfactorily complete a course of instruction in the theory and application of speed detection device operation as a condition for certification. The council shall establish and modify the curriculum for the course of instruction, including a minimum number of hours. Persons authorized and qualified to conduct the course of instruction required by this Code section shall be certified by the council as speed detection device operator instructors upon complying with requirements prescribed by the council. The council shall have the authority to recognize instruction received by persons subject to the requirements of this Code section if, in the determination of the council, the instruction is at least equivalent to that required by this chapter. If the instruction is recognized, then it shall be accepted in lieu of part or parts of the minimum hours of instruction required for speed detection device certification by this chapter. Should any person fail to complete successfully the training requirements for operation of speed detection devices, he or she shall not perform any functions related to the use of the devices until such training shall have been successfully completed and until such time as the council shall issue appropriate certification.
