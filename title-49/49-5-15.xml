          <p>No person shall bring or send into the state any child for the purpose of placing him or procuring his adoption without first filing notice with the department. He shall file with the department a bond payable to the state for each child he intends to send or bring, approved by the department, in the penal sum of $1,000.00, conditioned that he will not send or bring into the state any child who is incorrigible or unsound in mind or body; that he will remove any such child who becomes a public charge or who, in the opinion of the department, becomes a menace to the community prior to his adoption or becoming of legal age; and that the person with whom the child is placed shall be responsible for his proper care and training. Before any child shall be brought or sent into the state for the purpose of placing him in a foster home, the person so bringing or sending such child shall first notify the department of his intention and shall obtain from the department a certificate stating that such home is, in the opinion of the department, a suitable home for the child. Such notification shall state the name, age, and personal description of the child; the name and address of the person with whom the child is to be placed; and such other information as may be required by the department. The person bringing or sending such child into the state shall report at least once each year and at such other times as the department shall direct as to the location and well-being of the child so long as such child shall remain within the state and until he shall have reached the age of 18 or shall have been legally adopted.</p>
