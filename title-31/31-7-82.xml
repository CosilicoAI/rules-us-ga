          <p>Obligations of an authority evidenced by certificates and trust indentures and mortgages executed in connection therewith may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by the authority. The authority may in such instruments provide for pledging of all or any part of its gross or net fees, tolls, charges, revenues, and incomes and for mortgaging of all or any part of its real or personal property and may covenant against pledging any or all of its income, revenues, tolls, charges, or fees; and the authority may further provide for the disposition of proceeds realized from the sale of any mutilated certificates and necessary provisions as to payment and redemption of such certificates. Undertakings of an authority may likewise prescribe the procedure by which certificate holders may enforce rights against the authority and provide for such rights upon breach of any covenant, condition, or obligation of the authority. Trust indentures, mortgages, or deeds to secure debt executed by an authority may provide that, in the event of default by the authority in the payment of principal and interest on certificates or obligations or breach of any covenant, a trustee or trustees appointed under the terms of the indenture, mortgage, or deed to secure debt, which shall be a bank or trust company authorized to exercise trust powers, may take possession of and use, operate, and manage any project mortgaged as security for the repayment of any indebtedness of the authority and provide the terms and conditions upon which the trustee or trustees or holders of certificates may enforce any right relating to such certificates. Such trust indentures, mortgages, and deeds to secure debt may contain such provisions, not inconsistent with law, as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the authority.</p>
