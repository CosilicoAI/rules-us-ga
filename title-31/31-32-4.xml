          <p>"GEORGIA ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR HEALTH CARE
   By: ________________________________________ Date of Birth: __________________
   (Print Name)
   (Month/Day/Year)
      This advance directive for health care has four parts:
      PART ONE
   HEALTH CARE AGENT.
      This part allows you to choose someone to make health care decisions for you when you cannot (or do not want to) make health care decisions for yourself.
    The person you choose is called a health care agent.
    You may also have your health care agent make decisions for you after your death with respect to an autopsy, organ donation, body donation, and final disposition of your body.
    You should talk to your health care agent about this important role
      .
   PART TWO
   TREATMENT PREFERENCES.
      This part allows you to state your treatment preferences if you have a terminal condition or if you are in a state of permanent unconsciousness.
    PART TWO will become effective only if you are unable to communicate your treatment preferences. Reasonable and appropriate efforts will be made to communicate with you about your treatment preferences before PART TWO becomes effective.
    You should talk to your family and others close to you about your treatment preferences
      .
   PART THREE
   GUARDIANSHIP.
      This part allows you to nominate a person to be your guardian should one ever be needed
      .
   PART FOUR
   EFFECTIVENESS AND SIGNATURES.
      This part requires your signature and the signatures of two witnesses.
    You must complete PART FOUR if you have filled out any other part of this form
      .
      You may fill out any or all of the first three parts listed above. You must fill out PART FOUR of this form in order for this form to be effective.
    You should give a copy of this completed form to people who might need it, such as your health care agent, your family, and your physician. Keep a copy of this completed form at home in a place where it can easily be found if it is needed. Review this completed form periodically to make sure it still reflects your preferences. If your preferences change, complete a new advance directive for health care.
    Using this form of advance directive for health care is completely optional. Other forms of advance directives for health care may be used in Georgia.
    You may revoke this completed form at any time. This completed form will replace any advance directive for health care, durable power of attorney for health care, health care proxy, or living will that you have completed before completing this form.
      [ PART ONE: HEALTH CARE AGENT ]
      [PART ONE will be effective even if PART TWO is not completed. A physician or health care provider who is directly involved in your health care may not serve as your health care agent. If you are married, a future divorce or annulment of your marriage will revoke the selection of your current spouse as your health care agent. If you are not married, a future marriage will revoke the selection of your health care agent unless the person you selected as your health care agent is your new spouse.]
(1) Health Care Agent
    I select the following person as my health care agent to make health care decisions for me:
    Name: ____________________________________________________________________
    Address: _________________________________________________________________
    Telephone Numbers: _______________________________________________________
    (Home, Work, and Mobile)
    (2)
       Back-up Health Care Agent
     [This section is optional.
PART ONE will be effective even if this section is left blank.]
       If my health care agent cannot be contacted in a reasonable time period and cannot be located with reasonable efforts or for any reason my health care agent is unavailable or unable or unwilling to act as my health care agent, then I select the following, each to act successively in the order named, as my back-up health care agent(s):
    Name: ____________________________________________________________________
    Address: _________________________________________________________________
    Telephone Numbers: _______________________________________________________
    (Home, Work, and Mobile)
    Name: ____________________________________________________________________
    Address: _________________________________________________________________
    Telephone Numbers: _______________________________________________________
    (Home, Work, and Mobile)
    (3)
       General Powers of Health Care Agent
       My health care agent will make health care decisions for me when I am unable to communicate my health care decisions or I choose to have my health care agent communicate my health care decisions.
    My health care agent will have the same authority to make any health care decision that I could make. My health care agent's authority includes, for example, the power to:
ì
Admit me to or discharge me from any hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, or other health care facility or service;
ì
Request, consent to, withhold, or withdraw any type of health care; and
ì
Contract for any health care facility or service for me, and to obligate me to pay for these services (and my health care agent will not be financially liable for any services or care contracted for me or on my behalf).
    My health care agent will be my personal representative for all purposes of federal or state law related to privacy of medical records (including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) and will have the same access to my medical records that I have and can disclose the contents of my medical records to others for my ongoing health care.
    My health care agent may accompany me in an ambulance or air ambulance if in the opinion of the ambulance personnel protocol permits a passenger and my health care agent may visit or consult with me in person while I am in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, or other health care facility or service if its protocol permits visitation.
    My health care agent may present a copy of this advance directive for health care in lieu of the original and the copy will have the same meaning and effect as the original.
    I understand that under Georgia law:
ì
My health care agent may refuse to act as my health care agent;
ì
A court can take away the powers of my health care agent if it finds that my health care agent is not acting properly; and
ì
My health care agent does not have the power to make health care decisions for me regarding psychosurgery, sterilization, or treatment or involuntary hospitalization for mental or emotional illness, developmental disability, or addictive disease.
    (4)
       Guidance for Health Care Agent
       When making health care decisions for me, my health care agent should think about what action would be consistent with past conversations we have had, my treatment preferences as expressed in PART TWO (if I have filled out PART TWO), my religious and other beliefs and values, and how I have handled medical and other important issues in the past. If what I would decide is still unclear, then my health care agent should make decisions for me that my health care agent believes are in my best interest, considering the benefits, burdens, and risks of my current circumstances and treatment options.
    (5)
       Powers of Health Care Agent After Death
(A)

       (B) Organ Donation and Donation of Body

    (Home, Work, and Mobile)
    I wish for my body to be:
    __________ (Initials) Buried
    OR
    __________ (Initials) Cremated
    [ PART TWO: TREATMENT PREFERENCES ]
       [PART TWO will be effective only if you are unable to communicate your treatment preferences after reasonable and appropriate efforts have been made to communicate with you about your treatment preferences. PART TWO will be effective even if PART ONE is not completed. If you have not selected a health care agent in PART ONE, or if your health care agent is not available, then PART TWO will provide your physician and other health care providers with your treatment preferences. If you have selected a health care agent in PART ONE, then your health care agent will have the authority to make all health care decisions for you regarding matters covered by PART TWO. Your health care agent will be guided by your treatment preferences and other factors described in Section (4) of PART ONE.]
       (6)
       Conditions

    (7)
       Treatment Preferences
     [State your treatment preference by initialing (A), (B), or (C). If you choose (C), state your additional treatment preferences by initialing one or more of the statements following (C). You may provide additional instructions about your treatment preferences in the next section. You will be provided with comfort care, including pain relief, but you may also want to state your specific preferences regarding pain relief in the next section.]
       If I am in any condition that I initialed in Section (6) above and I can no longer communicate my treatment preferences after reasonable and appropriate efforts have been made to communicate with me about my treatment preferences, then:
    (A) __________ (Initials) Try to extend my life for as long as possible, using all medications, machines, or other medical procedures that in reasonable medical judgment could keep me alive. If I am unable to take nutrition or fluids by mouth, then I want to receive nutrition or fluids by tube or other medical means.

If you have selected a health care agent in PART ONE, you may (but are not required to) nominate the same person to be your guardian.
