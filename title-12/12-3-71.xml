          <p>The General Assembly finds that certain real property in Georgia, because it exhibits unique natural characteristics, special historical significance, or particular recreational value, constitutes a valuable heritage which should be available to all Georgians, now and in the future. The General Assembly further finds that much of this real property, because of Georgia's rapid progress over the past decade, has been altered, that its value as part of our heritage has been lost, and that such property which remains is in danger of being irreparably altered. The General Assembly declares, therefore, that there is an urgent public need to preserve important and endangered elements of Georgia's heritage, so as to allow present and future citizens to gain an understanding of their origins in nature and their roots in the culture of the past and to ensure a future sufficiency of recreational resources. The General Assembly asserts the public interest in the state's heritage by creating the Heritage Trust Program which shall be the responsibility of the Governor and the Department of Natural Resources and which shall seek to protect this heritage through the acquisition of fee simple title or lesser interests in valuable properties and by utilization of other available methods.</p>
