          <p>Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the director, upon receipt of evidence that the past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste is presenting or may present imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment or to the health of humans, may bring an action as provided in Code Section 12-8-72 to restrain immediately any person, including any past or present generator, past or present transporter, or past or present owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, who has caused or is causing or has contributed or is contributing to such handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal to stop such handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal or to take such other action as may be necessary.If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the environment or the health of humans solely by commencement of such a civil action, the director, with the concurrence of the Governor, may issue such emergency orders as may be necessary to protect the environment or the health of humans who are or may be affected by such past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal. Notwithstanding Code Sections 12-8-71, 12-8-72, 12-8-73, 12-8-74, 12-8-81, and 12-8-96, such order shall be immediately effective for a period of not more than 48 hours unless the director brings an action under the first sentence of this Code section before the expiration of such period.Whenever the director brings such an action within such period, such order shall be effective for such period of time as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter.</p>
