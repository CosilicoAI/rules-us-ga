          <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the director, upon receipt of evidence that a source or facility or combination of sources or facilities is presenting imminent and substantial danger to the health of persons, may bring an action as provided in Code Section 12-9-12 immediately to restrain any person causing or contributing to the alleged pollution through the emission of air contaminants to stop the emission of air pollutants causing or contributing to such pollution or to take such other action as may be necessary. If it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the health of persons solely by commencement of such a civil action, the director, with the concurrence of the Governor, may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the health of persons who are, or may be, affected by such pollution source or facility. Prior to issuing an order under this Code section, the director shall consult with local authorities in order to confirm the correctness of the information on which action proposed to be taken is based and to ascertain the action which such authorities are or will be taking. Notwithstanding Code Sections 12-9-12, 12-9-13, and 12-9-15, such order shall be immediately effective for a period of not more than 24 hours unless the director brings an action under the first sentence of this Code section before the expiration of such period. Whenever the director brings such an action within such period, such order shall be effective for a period of 48 hours or such longer period as may be authorized by the court pending litigation or thereafter.</p>
