              <p>The department shall develop and make available a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment form. On and after July 1, 2016, the department shall notify the chairpersons and each member of the House Committee on Health and Human Services and the Senate Health and Human Services Committee at least 60 days prior to implementing any modification of the POLST form. Such form shall provide directions regarding the patient's end of life care and may be voluntarily executed by either a patient who has decision-making capacity and an attending physician or, if the patient does not have decision-making capacity, by the patient's authorized person and an attending physician; provided, however, that this shall not prevent a health care facility from imposing additional administrative or procedural requirements regarding a patient's end of life care decisions. A POLST form may be executed when a patient has a serious illness or condition and the attending physician's reasoned judgment is that the patient will die within the next 365 days; provided, however, that a POLST form may be executed at any time if a person has been diagnosed with dementia or another progressive, degenerative disease or condition that attacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking, and behavior.

          <heading>Legislative findings</heading>
          <content>
            <p>§ 31-11-110. Legislative findingsThe General Assembly finds and declares that:
(1)  The rapid identification, diagnosis, and treatment of stroke can save the lives of stroke patients and in some cases can reverse neurological damage such as paralysis and speech and language impairments, leaving stroke patients with few or no neurological deficits;

(2)  Despite significant advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and the number one cause of disability in this country; an estimated 800,000 new and recurrent strokes occur each year in this country, and with the aging of the population, the number of persons who have strokes is projected to increase;

(3)  Although new treatments are available to improve the clinical outcomes of stroke, many acute care hospitals often face challenges in obtaining staff and equipment required to optimally triage and treat stroke patients, including the provision of optimal, safe, and effective emergency care for these patients;

(4)  Although the Georgia Coverdell Acute Stroke Registry currently exists within the Department of Public Health as a program whose purpose is to increase improvement of the quality of acute stroke care through collaborative efforts with participating hospitals in this state, less than one-third of Georgia's hospitals are currently enrolled in the program. Therefore, increased participation in and funding of this program in conjunction with the adherence to the tenets of this article would have profound effects on the quality of care for acute stroke patients in this state;

(5)  An effective system to support stroke survival is needed in our communities in order to treat stroke patients in a timely manner and to improve the overall treatment of stroke patients in order to increase survival and decrease the disabilities associated with stroke. There is a public health need for acute care hospitals in this state to establish stroke centers to ensure the rapid triage, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of patients suffering a stroke;(6)  At least three levels of stroke centers should be established for the treatment of acute stroke:
(A)  Comprehensive stroke centers should be established in hospitals to provide complete and specialized care to patients who experience the most complex strokes, which require specialized testing, highly technical procedures, and other interventions, and to provide education and guidance to primary and remote treatment stroke centers;

(B)  Primary stroke centers should be established in as many acute care hospitals as possible to evaluate, stabilize, and provide or arrange for treatment, care, and rehabilitative services to patients diagnosed with acute stroke; and

(C)  Remote treatment stroke centers should be established to evaluate, stabilize, and provide treatment to patients diagnosed with acute stroke in rural and other underserved areas of the state, because access to stroke care is limited in these areas due to the limited availability of professional specialists, high-tech imaging equipment, and transportation services;

(7)  Coordination between stroke centers should be encouraged through the establishment of coordinated stroke care agreements; and

(8)  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the residents of this state to establish a program to identify certified stroke centers throughout the state, to provide specific patient care and support services criteria that stroke centers must meet in order to ensure that stroke patients receive safe and effective care, and to provide financial support to acute care hospitals to encourage them to develop stroke centers in all areas of the state. Further, it is in the best interest of the people of this state to modify the state's emergency medical response system to assure that stroke patients may be quickly identified and transported to and treated in facilities that have specialized programs for providing timely and effective treatment for stroke patients.

            <p>§ 31-11-130. Legislative findingsThe General Assembly finds and declares that:
(1)  Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and in Georgia;

(2)  Georgia ranks as the thirty-eighth worst in the nation for numbers of deaths from cardiovascular disease;

(3)  There were 79,901 deaths in Georgia in 2015, and cardiovascular disease (excluding stroke) accounted for 23.6 percent of such deaths;

(4)  Approximately 40 percent of cardiac deaths occur suddenly, the result of a heart attack that is manifested by an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;

(5)  As of 2016, several states, but notably Arizona and Washington, have designated hospitals that are expert in cardiovascular disease care, much in the way that Georgia has stroke and trauma centers; Arizona and Washington have some of the lowest death rates for patients who have heart attacks, in part due to their designated cardiac centers; and

(6)  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the residents of this state to establish a program to identify emergency cardiac care centers throughout the state to ensure the rapid triage, assessment, treatment, and transport of patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or heart attack or its complications.

The department shall promulgate appropriate rules and regulations for the implementation of the provisions of this Code section in the case of a declaration of a public health emergency and shall include provisions permitting consideration of the opinion of a person's personal physician as to whether the vaccination is medically appropriate or advisable for such person.

              <p>The Georgia General Assembly makes the following findings: The attacks of September and October, 2001, on the United States have heightened concerns that terrorists may have access to the smallpox virus and may attempt to use it against the American public. In light of these concerns, and in order to secure public health and national security, the United States government has launched, and the State of Georgia has cooperated in, a smallpox vaccination and treatment program, with a recommendation for initial smallpox vaccinations for certain hospitals, health care workers, and emergency response workers. However, due to the virulent nature of smallpox and its vaccine, participation by hospitals and health care workers in such a program potentially increases their exposure to liability that, without sufficient legal protections, may significantly discourage their participation in the program. The federal government has determined, and the General Assembly agrees, that liability protection for those hospitals and health care workers who participate in such programs are integral to ensuring its maximum success. Accordingly, to achieve a potent and widespread smallpox vaccination and treatment program and maintain an effective defense against possible terrorist attacks, it is critical that hospitals and health care workers participating in such program be protected from potential legal liability absent their gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. The General Assembly therefore concludes that certain steps must be taken to encourage participation in the smallpox vaccination and treatment program in order to reserve to Georgia citizens continued access to smallpox vaccination and treatment services in the event of a terrorist attack.</p>

              <p>No person shall construct or operate a site or other facility for the concentration, storage, or burial of radioactive waste without first securing a permit for such construction or operation from the director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources. The director, under the conditions he prescribes, may require the submission of such plans, specifications, and other information as he deems relevant in connection with the issuance of such permit. The director may issue a permit for the construction or operation of such a site or other facility upon a determination that the construction or operation would be consistent with the purposes and stated policy of this chapter. Any permit which may be issued by the director shall specify the conditions under which the site or facility shall be operated. The director, in specifying such conditions, shall have the power and authority to require a permittee to establish and maintain records; to make reports; to install, maintain, and use monitoring equipment or methods including, but not limited to, biological monitoring methods or emission and ambient monitoring devices; to sample any emission or discharge in accordance with such methods, at such locations, at such intervals, and in such manner as the director shall prescribe; and to provide such other information as he may reasonably require. Any permit issued shall be subject to periodic review; and the director may revoke or modify any permit if the holder fails to comply with any conditions thereof. The director is authorized to adopt, modify, repeal, and promulgate, after due notice and public hearing held in accordance with and established pursuant to Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," rules and regulations not inconsistent with this Code section, for purposes of administering this Code section.</p>

Each application for a specific license shall be in writing on forms prescribed and furnished by the Department of Natural Resources and shall state such information and be accompanied by such documents, including, but not limited to, plans, specifications, and reports for new construction or material alterations, as the Department of Natural Resources may determine to be reasonable and necessary to decide the qualifications of the applicant to protect the public health and safety. The Department of Natural Resources may require any applications or statements to be made under oath or affirmation. Each license shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as the Department of Natural Resources may deem necessary.  No license issued under the authority of this chapter and no right to possess or utilize sources of ionizing radiation granted by any license shall be assigned or in any manner disposed of; and the terms and conditions of all licenses shall be subject to amendment, revision, or modification by rules, regulations, or orders issued in accordance with this chapter.

The petition executed under oath shall state the specific evidence supporting the allegations, that the evidence has existed within the preceding 30 days, that the person named therein has active tuberculosis and is violating the rules and regulations of the department or the orders of the county board of health and presents a substantial risk of exposing other persons to an imminent danger of infection, after having been directed by the county board of health or department to comply with such rules, regulations, or orders, and that the public health requires commitment of the person named therein. The petition must be accompanied by a certificate of a physician stating that the physician knows or suspects that the person named therein may have active tuberculosis, the evidence which forms the basis of this opinion, and whether a full evaluation of the person is necessary.

Where a danger exists that the person named in the petition may abscond or conceal himself or herself or where the person is conducting himself or herself so as to present a substantial risk of exposing other persons to an imminent danger of infection, the court may, as a part of the order made pursuant to Code Section 31-14-3, direct the sheriff or the sheriff's deputies to take such person into custody pending hearing and impose such confinement as will not endanger other persons. An affidavit shall be attached to the petition containing the specific facts supporting the need for custody pending hearing.

            <p>§ 31-14-8. Period of confinement of patients committed under chapterUpon commitment the patient shall be confined in a hospital or facility approved by the department for the care of tubercular patients for a period not to exceed two years unless, before the expiration of such two-year period, the designated responsible physician of the tuberculosis inpatient unit determines that the following conditions no longer exist:
(1)  The patient has active tuberculosis; or

(2)  The patient has active tuberculosis and there is a substantial likelihood of future noncompliance with a proposed treatment plan which will predictably lead to the development of infectious drug-resistant tuberculosis. The likelihood of noncompliance must be based upon a history of noncompliance with treatment; provided, however, that short emergency leaves in the event of death or critical illness in the family or short therapeutic leaves may be granted under conditions which would not adversely affect the public health and in accordance with rules and regulations established by the department.

              <p>It is declared and found that one of the most serious and tragic problems facing the public health and welfare is the death of thousands of persons in this state every year from cancer, although the present state of medical arts and technology could return many of these persons to a socially productive life. Advances and discoveries in the treatment of patients suffering from cancer now allow not mere survival, but rehabilitation of these patients to their normal occupations and activities. Presently, many of these patients are dying for lack of personal financial resources to pay for the care which they need.</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 31-15-5. Duties of commissionerThe commissioner, with the advice of the Cancer Advisory Committee, shall:
(1)  Develop standards for determining eligibility of patients for care and treatment under this program, set standards for the equipping and staffing of cancer clinics located strategically throughout the state and so placed that patients requiring treatment will not have to travel more than 75 miles to secure such treatment. When the clinics meet such standards, they shall be certified by the department. Patients treated at uncertified cancer clinics shall not be eligible for state aid for reimbursement;

(2)  In the event that federal grant programs become available for patient care, the commissioner may allocate state matching funds in whatever department of state government they may be administered so as to maximize the total funds available and to obtain funding needed by the specific patient population which is declared eligible. These programs include but are not restricted to Medicaid, crippled children's services, and vocational rehabilitation;

(3)  Extend financial aid to persons suffering from cancer to enable them to obtain the medical, nursing, pharmaceutical, and technical services necessary in caring for such disease. Criteria and procedures for financial aid will be developed by the Division of Physical Health in accordance with the principle that pauperization of a functional family unit will subvert the rehabilitative purposes of this program and will be more costly to the state in the long run;

(4)  Assist in the development and expansion, by grant or by contract, of programs for the care and treatment of persons suffering from cancer so that the most efficient and effective treatment may be offered to the patients certified as eligible;

(5)  Assist in the development of programs for the prevention of cancer;

(6)  Assist in the development and execution of programs for the early detection of cancer, such as breast self-examination for breast cancer and the Papanicolaou test for cancer of the cervix;

(7)  Institute and support, directly or through health organizations such as the American Cancer Society and the Georgia Cancer Management Network, educational programs for physicians, providers of health care, and the public concerning cancer, including the dissemination of information regarding prevention, early detection, and treatment; and

(8)  Support a state-wide registry of all patients treated in certified cancer clinics in order to evaluate the nature and extent of the incidence of cancer and the effectiveness of treatment.

              <p>It is declared and found that one of the most serious and tragic problems facing the public health and welfare is the death of hundreds of persons in this state every year from chronic renal disease, although the present state of medical arts and technology could return these persons to a socially productive life. Advances and discoveries in the treatment of patients suffering from chronic renal disease now allow not mere survival but rehabilitation of these patients to their normal occupations and activities. Presently, these patients are dying for lack of personal financial resources to pay for the expensive equipment and care which they need.</p>

              <p>The state recognizes its responsibilities to allow its citizens to keep their health without being pauperized and to use its resources and organization to aid in gathering and disseminating information on the treatment of chronic renal disease. It is believed that these programs will, by making treatment of chronic renal disease easily available, steadily lower the cost of such treatment.

              <p>Declaration of policy.  The General Assembly finds that the present laws of this state provide no means for the performance of sterilization procedures upon persons who, because of a developmental disability, brain damage, or both, are irreversibly and incurably mentally incompetent to the degree that such persons, with or without economic aid (charitable or otherwise) from others, could not provide care and support for any children procreated by them in such a way that such children could reasonably be expected to survive to the age of 18 years without suffering or sustaining serious mental or physical harm.</p>

              <p>Definitions.  As used in this Code section, the term "person subject to this Code section" means a person who, because of a developmental disability, brain damage, or both, is irreversibly and incurably mentally incompetent to the degree that such person, with or without economic aid (charitable or otherwise) from others, could not provide care and support for any children procreated by such person in such a way that such children could reasonably be expected to survive to the age of 18 years without suffering or sustaining serious mental or physical harm, when there has been, according to the procedures of this Code section as hereinafter stated, the required finding that the condition of such person is irreversible and incurable.</p>

            <p>§ 31-27-5. Bond requirement; cash deposit in lieu of bond
The person holding or promoting a mass gathering shall provide a bond of $1 million issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state. The purpose of the bond shall be to guarantee full compliance with this chapter as well as other applicable provisions of this title and the provisions of Title 12, relating to air quality control and water supply quality control, and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to cover cleanup of the site. This bond shall be in favor of the state for the benefit of any person who is damaged as a result of the activity of a mass gathering. Any person claiming against the bond may maintain an action at law against the person holding or promoting the mass gathering and the surety. In lieu of furnishing the bond, the person holding or promoting a mass gathering may deposit with the commissioner a cash deposit in like amount. However, the bond specified in this Code section shall not be required in cases where the other requirements of this chapter are met by the applicant for a permit and an incorporated municipality or county owns the area upon which the mass gathering is to be held and commits itself, in writing, to clean up the site upon which the gathering is to be held.

          <content>
            <p>§ 31-32-2. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Advance directive for health care" means a written document voluntarily executed by a declarant in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 31-32-5.

(2)  "Attending physician" means the physician who has primary responsibility at the time of reference for the treatment and care of the declarant.

(5)  "Health care" means any care, treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, treat, or provide for a declarant's physical or mental health or personal care.

(6)  "Health care agent" means a person appointed by a declarant to act for and on behalf of the declarant to make decisions related to consent, refusal, or withdrawal of any type of health care and decisions related to autopsy, anatomical gifts, and final disposition of a declarant's body when a declarant is unable or chooses not to make health care decisions for himself or herself. The term "health care agent" shall include any back-up or successor agent appointed by the declarant.

(7)  "Health care facility" means a hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, institution, home, residential or nursing facility, treatment facility, and any other facility or service which has a valid permit or provisional permit issued under Chapter 7 of this title or which is licensed, accredited, or approved under the laws of any state, and includes hospitals operated by the United States government or by any state or subdivision thereof.

(9)  "Life-sustaining procedures" means medications, machines, or other medical procedures or interventions which, when applied to a declarant in a terminal condition or in a state of permanent unconsciousness, could in reasonable medical judgment keep the declarant alive but cannot cure the declarant and where, in the judgment of the attending physician and a second physician, death will occur without such procedures or interventions. The term "life-sustaining procedures" shall not include the provision of nourishment or hydration but a declarant may direct the withholding or withdrawal of the provision of nourishment or hydration in an advance directive for health care.

(14)  "Terminal condition" means an incurable or irreversible condition which would result in the declarant's death in a relatively short period of time.

   By:                      Date of Birth:                                    

                   (Print Name)                                          
          (Month/Day/Year)

   This advance directive for health care has four parts:

PART ONE                      HEALTH CARE AGENT. This part allows you to 
choose someone to make health care decisions for you when you cannot (or do 
not want to) make health care decisions for yourself.  The person you choose 
is called a health care agent.  You may also have your health care agent make 
decisions for you after your death with respect to an autopsy, organ donation, 
body donation, and final disposition of your body.  You should talk to your 
health care agent about this important role.

PART TWO                      TREATMENT PREFERENCES.  This part allows you 
to state your treatment preferences if you have a terminal condition or if you 
are in a state of permanent unconsciousness.  PART TWO will become effective 
only if you are unable to communicate your treatment preferences. Reasonable 
and appropriate efforts will be made to communicate with you about your

serve as your health care agent. If you are married, a future divorce or

your health care agent. If you are not married, a future marriage will revoke 
the selection of your health care agent unless the person you selected as your 
health care agent is your new spouse.]

                                       (Home, Work, and Mobile) (2)   Back-up Health Care Agent      [This section is optional. PART ONE will be effective even if this section 
is left blank.]
   If my health care agent cannot be contacted in a reasonable time period and 
   cannot be located with reasonable efforts or for any reason my health care 
   agent is unavailable or unable or unwilling to act as my health care agent,

          <content>
            <p>§ 31-32-8. Duties and responsibilities of health care providersEach health care provider and each other person with whom a health care agent interacts under an advance directive for health care shall be subject to the following duties and responsibilities:
(1)  It is the responsibility of the health care agent or declarant to notify the health care provider of the existence of the advance directive for health care and any amendment or revocation thereof. A health care provider furnished with a copy of an advance directive for health care shall make such copy a part of the declarant's medical records and shall enter in the records any change in or termination of the advance directive for health care by the declarant that becomes known to the health care provider. A health care provider shall grant a health care agent adequate access to a declarant when a declarant is admitted to any health care facility. Whenever a health care provider believes a declarant is unable to understand the general nature of the health care procedure which the provider deems necessary, the health care provider shall consult with any available health care agent known to the health care provider who then has power to act for the declarant under an advance directive for health care;

(2)  A health care decision made by a health care agent in accordance with the terms of an advance directive for health care shall be complied with by every health care provider to whom the decision is communicated, subject to the health care provider's right to administer treatment for the declarant's comfort or alleviation of pain; provided, however, that if the health care provider is unwilling to comply with the health care agent's decision, the health care provider shall promptly inform the health care agent who shall then be responsible for arranging for the declarant's transfer to another health care provider. A health care provider who is unwilling to comply with the health care agent's decision shall provide reasonably necessary consultation and care in connection with the pending transfer;

(3)  At the declarant's expense and subject to reasonable rules of the health care provider to prevent disruption of the declarant's health care, each health care provider shall give a health care agent authorized to receive such information under an advance directive for health care the same right the declarant has to examine and copy any part or all of the declarant's medical records that the health care agent deems relevant to the exercise of the health care agent's powers, whether the records relate to mental health or any other medical condition and whether they are in the possession of or maintained by any physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, health care facility, or other health care provider, notwithstanding the provisions of any statute or rule of law to the contrary; and

(4)  If and to the extent an advance directive for health care empowers the health care agent to direct that an autopsy of the declarant's body be made; to make an anatomical gift of any part or all of the declarant's body pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 5 of Title 44, the "Georgia Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act"; or to direct the final disposition of the declarant's body, including funeral arrangements, burial, or cremation, the decisions of the health care agent on such matters shall be deemed the act of the declarant or of the person who has priority under law to make the necessary decisions, and each person to whom a direction by the health care agent in accordance with the terms of the agency is communicated shall comply with such direction to the extent it is in accord with reasonable medical standards or other relevant standards at the time of reference.

              <p>The party requesting the patient's records shall be responsible to the provider for the costs of copying and mailing the patient's record. A charge of up to $20.00 may be collected for search, retrieval, and other direct administrative costs related to compliance with the request under this chapter. A fee for certifying the medical records may also be charged not to exceed $7.50 for each record certified. The actual cost of postage incurred in mailing the requested records may also be charged. In addition, copying costs for a record which is in paper form shall not exceed $.75 per page for the first 20 pages of the patient's records which are copied; $.65 per page for pages 21 through 100; and $.50 for each page copied in excess of 100 pages. All of the fees allowed by this Code section may be adjusted annually in accordance with the medical component of the consumer price index. The Department of Community Health shall be responsible for calculating this annual adjustment, which will become effective on July 1 of each year. To the extent the request for medical records includes portions of records which are not in paper form, including but not limited to radiology films, models, or fetal monitoring strips, the provider shall be entitled to recover the full reasonable cost of such reproduction. Payment of such costs may be required by the provider prior to the records being furnished. This subsection shall not apply to records requested in order to make or complete an application for a disability benefits program.</p>

            <p>§ 31-35-1. Legislative finding
The General Assembly finds and declares that, by reason of their employment, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and public safety officers are required to work in the midst of and are subject to exposure to infectious diseases, especially hepatitis B and hepatitis C; that the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have estimated that 200,000 persons in the United States are infected each year with hepatitis B and of that number 25 percent become ill, 10,000 require hospitalization, and 5,000 die; that it is estimated that there are from 500,000 to 1,000,000 infectious hepatitis B carriers in the United States, of which up to 80 percent of such chronic carriers are unaware that they have hepatitis B and are capable of spreading it; that 3.9 million Americans are infected with chronic hepatitis C; that 350,000 to 450,000 new cases of chronic hepatitis C occur each year; that there is no known cure for hepatitis B or hepatitis C and for firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and public safety officers, there is no way of knowing who among those being helped at an accident, a fire, or any incident are hepatitis B or hepatitis C carriers. The General Assembly further finds and declares that all the aforementioned conditions exist and arise out of or in the course of such employment.

              <p>of this Code section shall use upper and lower case letters which are at least two inches and one inch in height, respectively, and shall have the following wording:
DANGER -- ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION

      -Follow instruction.
      -Avoid overexposure.  As with natural sunlight, overexposure can cause eye and skin injury and allergic reactions. Repeated exposure may cause premature aging of the skin and skin cancer.
      -Wear protective eyewear.

FAILURE TO USE PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR
MAY RESULT IN SEVERE BURNS OR
LONG-TERM INJURY TO THE EYES.

      -Medications or cosmetics may increase your sensitivity to the ultraviolet radiation.  Consult a physician before using sunlamp or tanning equipment if you are using medications or have a history of skin problems or believe yourself to be especially sensitive to sunlight.
      -If you do not tan in the sun, you are unlikely to tan from the use of this product.

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE AT ANY ONE SESSION
SHOULD NEVER EXCEED 15 MINUTES.

      According to the research and clinical experience of the American Academy of Dermatology, excessive or improper exposure to ultraviolet light can cause harmful changes in the skin and other organs, including skin cancer, cataracts, impairment of the immune system, premature aging, and photosensitivity.  These are virtually the same risks associated with outdoor tanning.

            <p>§ 31-39-1. Legislative findings and intent
The General Assembly finds that although cardiopulmonary resuscitation has proved invaluable in the reversal of sudden, unexpected death, it is appropriate for an attending physician, in certain circumstances, to issue an order not to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a patient where appropriate consent or authorization has been obtained.  The General Assembly further finds that there is a need to establish and clarify the rights and obligations of patients, their families or representatives, and health care providers regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the issuance of orders not to resuscitate.  The General Assembly further finds that, in the interest of protecting individual autonomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation in some circumstances may cause loss of patient dignity and unnecessary pain and suffering. In recognition of the considerable uncertainty in the medical and legal professions as to the legality of implementing orders not to resuscitate, in recognition of the request of the Supreme Court of Georgia for legislative guidance in this area, and in recognition of the dignity and privacy which patients have a right to expect, the General Assembly declares that the laws of the State of Georgia shall recognize the right of patients or other authorized persons to instruct physicians and other health care personnel to refrain from cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

              <p>It shall be lawful for the attending physician to issue an order not to resuscitate pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. Any written order issued by the attending physician using the term "do not resuscitate," "DNR," "order not to resuscitate," "do not attempt resuscitation," "DNAR," "no code," "allow natural death," "AND," "order to allow natural death," or substantially similar language in the patient's chart shall constitute a legally sufficient order and shall authorize a physician, health care professional, nurse, physician assistant, caregiver, or emergency medical technician to withhold or withdraw cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Such an order shall remain effective, whether or not the patient is receiving treatment from or is a resident of a health care facility, until the order is canceled as provided in Code Section 31-39-5 or until consent for such order is revoked as provided in Code Section 31-39-6, whichever occurs earlier. An attending physician who has issued such an order and who transfers care of the patient to another physician shall inform the receiving physician and the health care facility, if applicable, of the order.</p>

              <p>The General Assembly finds that childhood lead poisoning is a devastating environmental health hazard to the children of this state. Exposure to even low levels of lead increases a child's risks of developing permanent reading and learning disabilities, intelligence quotient deficiencies, impaired hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity, behavior problems, and other neurological problems. It is estimated that thousands of children below the age of six are affected by lead poisoning in Georgia. Childhood lead poisoning is dangerous to the public health, safety, and general welfare.</p>

              <p>Childhood lead poisoning is the result of environmental exposure to lead. The most significant source of environmental lead is lead-based paint, particularly in housing built prior to 1978, which becomes accessible to children as paint chips, house dust, and soil contaminated by lead-based paint. The danger posed by lead-based paint hazards can be controlled by abatement, renovation, or interim controls of lead-based paint or by measures to limit exposure to lead-based paint hazards.</p>

              <p>It is crucial that the identification of lead hazards and subsequent implementation of interim control, renovation, or abatement procedures be accomplished in a manner that does not result in additional harm to the public or the environment. Improper lead abatement or renovation constitutes a serious threat to persons residing in or otherwise using an affected structure or site, to those performing such work, to the environment, and to the general public.</p>

              <p>The General Assembly finds that childhood lead poisoning prevention activities are currently carried out within the Environmental Health and Injury Prevention, Epidemiology and Prevention, and Laboratory Branches of the Department of Public Health. These activities include lead poisoning case identification, laboratory support, identification of exposure sources, environmental management, and lead hazard reduction. Childhood lead poisoning cases are identified through screening tests conducted by public health clinics and private health care providers and by laboratory reporting of test results. In 1994, lead poisoning was established as a notifiable condition and made part of the Notifiable Disease reporting system.</p>

              <p>The General Assembly further finds that the Georgia Public Health Laboratory is licensed and certified to analyze blood specimens for lead. Laboratory services are provided for children screened in public health clinics and for children without health insurance screened by private health care providers. For each reported case of lead poisoning, an environmental investigation is conducted to identify the source of lead. Environmental health specialists assess the primary residence and other locations frequented by the lead poisoned child. Information is collected from parents and caregivers; on-site surface testing and environmental sample collection and analysis are done as needed. When the lead source is identified, recommendations are made for the mitigation or abatement of the lead hazard. Identified lead poisoning cases are tracked collaboratively by public health nurses and environmental health specialists to assure that appropriate treatment is received and that the child does not reenter the environment where the exposure occurred.

Such cleaning activities shall include:
(1)  Wiping clean all window sills with a damp cloth or sponge at least weekly;

(2)  Regularly washing all surfaces accessible to the child;

(3)  In the case of a leased residential housing unit, identifying any deteriorated paint in the unit and notifying the owner or managing agent of such conditions within 72 hours of discovery; and

(4)  Identifying and understanding potential lead poisoning hazards in the environment of each child under the age of six in the housing unit including vinyl miniblinds, playground equipment, soil, and painted surfaces and taking steps to prevent the child from ingesting lead, such as encouraging the child to wash his or her face and hands frequently and especially after playing outdoors.

          <heading>Findings of General Assembly</heading>
          <content>
            <p>§ 31-43-2. Findings of General AssemblyThe General Assembly makes the following findings:
(1)  There is a silent health crisis affecting the health and well-being of Georgia's men;

(2)  This health crisis is of particular concern to men, but is also a concern for women, and especially to those who have fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers;

(3)  Men's health is likewise a concern for employers who lose productive employees as well as pay the costs of medical care, and is a concern to state government and society which absorb the enormous costs of premature death and disability, including the costs of caring for dependents left behind;

(4)  The life expectancy gap between men and women has steadily increased from one year in 1920 to seven years in 1990;

(5)  Almost twice as many men than women die from heart disease, and 28.5 percent of all men die as a result of stroke;

(6)  In 1995, blood pressure of black males was 356 percent higher than that of white males, and the death rate for stroke was 97 percent higher for black males than for white males;

(7)  The incidence of stroke among men is 19 percent higher than for women;

(8)  Significantly more men than women are diagnosed with AIDS each year;

(9)  Fifty percent more men than women die of cancer;

(10)  Although the incidence of depression is higher in women, the rate of life-threatening depression is higher in men, with men representing 80 percent of all suicides cases, and with men 43 times more likely to be admitted to psychiatric hospitals than women;

(11)  Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States among men, accounting for 36 percent of all cancer cases;

(12)  An estimated 180,000 men will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer this year alone, of which 37,000 will die;

(13)  Prostate cancer rates increase sharply with age, and more than 75 percent of such cases are diagnosed in men age 65 and older;

(14)  The incidence of prostate cancer and the resulting mortality rate in African American men is twice that in white men;

(15)  Studies show that men are at least 25 percent less likely than women to visit a doctor, and are significantly less likely to have regular physician check-ups and obtain preventive screening tests for serious diseases;

(16)  Appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol screens, in conjunction with clinical exams and self-testing, can result in the early detection of many problems and in increased survival rates;

(17)  Educating men, their families, and health care providers about the importance of early detection of male health problems can result in reducing rates of mortality for male-specific diseases, as well as improve the health of Georgia's men and its overall economic well-being;

(18)  Recent scientific studies have shown that regular medical exams, preventive screenings, regular exercise, and healthy eating habits can help save lives; and

(19)  A Commission on Men's Health is needed to investigate these findings and take such further actions as may be needed to promote men's health in this state.

            <p>§ 31-49-1. Legislative findings
The General Assembly finds and declares that it is estimated that as many as 55,000 Georgia residents suffer from lupus, a life-long autoimmune disease in which the immune system becomes unbalanced, causing inflammation, tissue damage, seizures, strokes, heart attacks, miscarriages, and organ failure. Although anyone can develop lupus, it strikes mostly women of childbearing age; African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women are two to three times more likely than Caucasians to develop lupus. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose and often is misdiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. It is in the public interest for this state to establish an entity to develop and implement a comprehensive program to improve education and awareness about lupus for health care providers and the general public.

All rules and regulations of the Department of Public Health and any county board of health shall be adopted after due notice to and hearing by persons and parties affected thereby; and such rules and regulations shall be maintained in a book kept for that purpose, orderly arranged and indexed and subject to inspection by the public during regular business hours. The agency adopting such rules and regulations shall make copies thereof available for distribution to persons interested in or affected thereby. Such agencies are also authorized to provide for the mimeographing, printing, or other reproduction of their regulations and the distribution thereof. No rule or regulation shall become effective as law until 30 days after its adoption, except in cases of emergencies constituting an imminent threat to the public, in which event such rules or regulations shall become effective upon adoption; but, in all such cases, the agency adopting same shall as a part thereof state the conditions found by it to justify such immediate effectiveness. Where deemed desirable by the agency, hearing and notice as provided in Code Section 31-5-2 may be conducted by it prior to adoption of any rule or regulation.

(B)  In excess of the statutory authority of the department;

(C)  Made upon unlawful procedure;

(D)  Affected by other error of law;

All matters so classified shall not be subject to public inspection or discovery and shall not be subject to production or disclosure in any court of law or elsewhere until and unless the judge of the court of competent jurisdiction, after in camera inspection, determines that the public interest requires such production and disclosure or that such production and disclosure may be necessary in the interests of justice.

              <p>The Department of Public Health and all county boards of health and the Department of Community Health, as appropriate, are empowered to institute appropriate proceedings for injunction in the courts of competent jurisdiction in this state for the purpose of enjoining a violation of any provision of this title as now existing or as may be hereafter amended or of any regulation or order duly issued by the department, any county board of health, or the Department of Community Health provided that this Code section shall not apply to violations of the provisions of Chapter 20 of this title. The department, the county boards of health, and the Department of Community Health, as appropriate, are also empowered to maintain action for injunction to abate any public nuisance which is injurious to the public health, safety, or comfort. Such actions may be maintained notwithstanding the fact that such violation also constitutes a crime and notwithstanding that other adequate remedies at law exist. Such actions may be instituted in the name of the department, any county board, or the Department of Community Health, as the case may be, in the county in which a violation of any provision of this title occurs. For purposes of this Code section, the county boards of health are declared to be legal entities capable of maintaining actions in their respective names without naming the individuals constituting such board, or acting on behalf of the department, as the case may be.</p>

The description shall be based on the physician's knowledge of the proposed treatment in conjunction with an awareness of the patient's condition;

(5)  A statement that the patient understands that his or her health benefit plan is not obligated to pay for the investigational drug, biological product, or device, or any care or treatment consequent to the use of such drug, product, or device, unless such health benefit plan is specifically required to do so by law or contract;

(6)  A statement that the patient understands that his or her eligibility for hospice care may be withdrawn if he or she begins treatment with the investigational drug, biological product, or device but that such hospice care may be reinstated if such treatment ends and he or she meets hospice eligibility requirements; and

              <p>of this Code section. A certificate of need shall only be issued to a destination cancer hospital that locates itself and all affiliated facilities within 25 miles of a commercial airport in this state with five or more runways. Such destination cancer hospital shall not be required to apply for or obtain additional certificates of need for new institutional health services related to the treatment of cancer patients, and such new institutional health services related to the treatment of cancer patients offered by the destination cancer hospital shall not be reviewed under any service-specific need methodology or rules except for those promulgated by the department for destination cancer hospitals. After commencing operations, in order to add an additional new institutional health service, a destination cancer hospital shall apply for and obtain an additional certificate of need under the applicable statutory provisions and any rules promulgated by the department for destination cancer hospitals, and such applications shall only be granted if the patient base of such destination cancer hospital is composed of at least 65 percent of out-of-state patients for two consecutive years. The department may apply rules for a destination cancer hospital only for those services that the department determines are to be used by the destination cancer hospital in connection with the treatment of cancer. In no case shall destination cancer hospital specific rules be used in the case of an application for open heart surgery, perinatal services, cardiac catheterization, and other services deemed by the department to be not reasonably related to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer; provided, however, that the department shall apply the destination cancer hospital specific rules if a destination cancer hospital applies for services and equipment required for it to meet federal or state laws applicable to a hospital.

                <p>of subsection (b.1) of Code Section 31-6-42. Because destination cancer hospitals provide services primarily to out-of-state residents, the number of beds, services, and equipment destination cancer hospitals use shall not be counted as part of the department's inventory when determining the need for those items by other providers. No person shall be issued more than one certificate of need for a destination cancer hospital. Nothing in this Code section shall in any way require a destination cancer hospital to obtain a certificate of need for any purpose that is otherwise exempt from the certificate of need requirement. Beginning January 1, 2010, the department shall not accept any application for a certificate of need for a new destination cancer hospital; provided, however, all other provisions regarding the upgrading, replacing, or purchasing of diagnostic or therapeutic equipment shall be applicable to an existing destination cancer hospital.</p>

              <p>The commissioner shall be authorized, with the approval of the board, to place a temporary moratorium of up to six months on the issuance of certificates of need for new and emerging health care services. Any such moratorium placed shall be for the purpose of promulgating rules and regulations regarding such new and emerging health care services. A moratorium may be extended one time for an additional three months if circumstances warrant, as approved by the board. In the event that final rules and regulations are not promulgated within the time period allowed by the moratorium, any applications received by the department for a new and emerging health care service shall be reviewed under existing general statutes and regulations relating to certificates of need.

              <p>Notwithstanding other provisions of this article, when the Governor has declared a state of emergency in a region of the state, existing health care facilities in the affected region may seek emergency approval from the department to make expenditures in excess of the capital expenditure threshold or to offer services that may otherwise require a certificate of need. The department shall give special expedited consideration to such requests and may authorize such requests for good cause. Once the state of emergency has been lifted, any services offered by an affected health care facility under this subsection shall cease to be offered until such time as the health care facility that received the emergency authorization has requested and received a certificate of need. For purposes of this subsection, "good cause" means that authorization of the request shall directly resolve a situation posing an immediate threat to the health and safety of the public.

              <p>On and after July 1, 2008, the appeal panel shall be composed of five members appointed by the Governor for a term of up to four years each. The Governor shall appoint to the appeal panel attorneys who practice law in this state and who are familiar with the health care industry but who do not have a financial interest in or represent or have any compensation arrangement with any health care facility. Each member of the appeal panel shall be an active member of the State Bar of Georgia in good standing, and each attorney shall have maintained such active status for the five years immediately preceding such person's appointment. The Governor shall name from among such members a chairperson and a vice chairperson of the appeal panel. The vice chairperson shall have the same authority as the chairperson; provided, however, the vice chairperson shall not exercise such authority unless expressly delegated by the chairperson or in the event the chairperson becomes incapacitated, as determined by the Governor. Vacancies on the appeal panel caused by resignation, death, or any other cause shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointment. No person required to register with the Secretary of State as a lobbyist or registered agent shall be eligible for appointment by the Governor to the appeal panel.</p>

Members of the appeal panel shall serve as hearing officers for appeals that are assigned to them on a random basis by the chairperson of the appeal panel. The members of the appeal panel shall receive no salary but shall be reimbursed for their expenses in attending meetings and for transportation costs as authorized by Code Section 45-7-21, which provides for compensation and allowances of certain state officials; provided, however, that the chairperson and vice chairperson of the appeal panel shall also be compensated for their services rendered to the appeal panel outside of attendance at an appeal panel meeting, such as for time spent assigning hearing officers, the amount of which compensation shall be determined according to regulations of the Department of Administrative Services. Appeal panel members shall receive compensation for the administration of the cases assigned to them, including prehearing, hearing, and posthearing work, in an amount determined to be appropriate and reasonable by the Department of Administrative Services. Such compensation to the members of the appeal panel shall be made by the Department of Administrative Services.</p>

The issue for the decision by the hearing officer shall be whether, and the hearing officer shall order the issuance of a certificate of need if, in the hearing officer's judgment, the application is consistent with the considerations as set forth in Code Section 31-6-42 and the department's rules, as the hearing officer deems such considerations and rules applicable to the review of the project.

The hearing officer may consider the latest data available, including updates of studies previously submitted, in deciding whether an application is consistent with the applicable considerations or rules. The hearing officer shall consider the applicable considerations and rules in effect on the date the appeal is filed, even if the provisions of those considerations or rules were changed after the department's decision. The hearing officer may remand a matter to the department if the hearing officer determines that it would be beneficial for the department to consider new data, studies, or analyses that were not available before the decision or changes to the provisions of the applicable considerations or rules made after the department's decision.

By rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule, the department must state with particularity its reasons for rejecting or modifying such conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule and must make a finding that its substituted conclusion of law or interpretation of administrative rule is as or more reasonable than that which was rejected or modified. Rejection or modification of conclusions of law may not form the basis for rejection or modification of findings of fact. The commissioner may not reject or modify the findings of fact unless the commissioner first determines from a review of the entire record, and states with particularity in the order, that the findings of fact were not based upon any competent substantial evidence or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with the essential requirements of law.</p>

              <p>Whenever any licensed doctor of medicine, doctor of podiatric medicine, doctor of osteopathic medicine, or doctor of dentistry shall make application for permission to treat patients in any hospital owned or operated by the state, any political subdivision thereof, or any municipality, the hospital shall act in a nondiscriminatory manner upon such application expeditiously and without unnecessary delay considering the applicant on the basis of the applicant's demonstrated training, experience, competence, and availability and reasonable objectives, including, but not limited to, the appropriate utilization of hospital facilities; but in no event shall final action thereon be taken later than 90 days following receipt of the application; provided, however, whenever the applicant is licensed by any governmental entity outside the continental limits of the United States, the hospital shall have 120 days to take action following receipt of the application. This subsection shall apply solely to applications by licensed doctors of medicine, doctors of podiatric medicine, doctors of osteopathic medicine, and doctors of dentistry who are not members of the staff of the hospital in which privileges are sought at the time an application is submitted and by those not privileged, at such time, to practice in such hospital under a previous grant of privileges. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed so as to repeal the provisions of Code Section 31-7-15, to mandate hospitals to offer or provide any type of service or services not otherwise offered, or to prohibit a hospital with a clinical training program affiliated with a school of medicine from requiring an applicant to have a faculty teaching appointment as a condition of eligibility.</p>

The proceedings shall be filed in the county in which such persons reside or, in the case of a firm or corporation, where such firm or corporation maintains its principal office; and, unless it is shown that such person, firm, or corporation which has leased such medical facility, auxiliary medical facility, or mental health center would have been eligible to accept the grant-in-aid from the state in the first instance and the lease has been approved by the state agency or the sale or use has been approved by such agency, the writ of injunction shall issue and such person, firm, or corporation shall be perpetually enjoined throughout the state from operating in violation of the provisions of this subsection. It shall not be necessary in order to obtain the equitable relief provided in this subsection that the state agency show that such person, firm, or corporation is ineligible nor to prove that there is no adequate remedy at law. In addition, the state agency shall be entitled to bring an action and recover from the transferor and transferee of any facility specified in this subsection such percentage of the value of the facility as the state grant bore toward the total construction cost of that facility as determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in court.

              <p>There is created in and for each county and municipal corporation of the state a public body corporate and politic to be known as the "hospital authority" of such county or city, which shall consist of a board of not less than five nor more than nine members to be appointed by the governing body of the county or municipal corporation of the area of operation for staggered terms as specified by resolution of the governing body. The number of members of any hospital authority as of March 1, 1984, may be increased by not more than two additional members by the adoption of a resolution of the members of the hospital authority, and such additional members shall be appointed through the same process used for filling vacancies which was in effect for such hospital authority on January 1, 1984. Whenever an appointment to fill a vacancy on the board of any hospital authority is made, either for an unexpired term or a full term, consideration shall be given as to whether a licensed doctor of medicine or registered nurse currently serves on such authority. If no licensed doctor of medicine or registered nurse currently serves on such authority, then consideration shall be given to the nomination and choice of a licensed doctor of medicine or a registered nurse to fill such vacancy. No authority created under this Code section shall transact any business or exercise any powers under this Code section until the governing body of the area of operation shall, by proper resolution, declare that there is need for an authority to function in such county or municipal corporation. Copies of a resolution so adopted and any resolution adopted by the governing body providing for filling vacancies in the membership of the authority or making any changes in membership shall be filed with the department.</p>

It is the further intent of the General Assembly that, whenever an authority ceases to perform the minimum functions required for the continued operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the county or municipality, a procedure be made available to recognize the failure of the authority to perform these minimum functions and to provide for the orderly and responsible reorganization of the authority.</p>

              <p>Whenever it appears that an authority has ceased to perform the minimum functions required for the continued operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the county or municipality in which the authority is authorized to function, a petition may be filed in the superior court in the county requesting that the members of the authority be removed from office and that any vacancy created by a removal be filled as provided in Code Section 31-7-72 for the initial appointment of members of an authority. Each such petition shall be filed by one or more residents of the county in which the authority is authorized to function, or by the county governing authority, and shall be supported by petition of a number of residents of the county equal to 5 percent or more of the number of electors registered to vote in the general election last held in the county. In the case of an authority authorized to function solely within a municipality, the petition shall be filed by one or more residents of the municipality in which the authority is authorized to function, or by the municipal governing authority, and shall be supported by petition of a number of residents of the municipality equal to 5 percent or more of the number of electors registered to vote in the general election last held in the municipality.</p>

            <p>§ 31-7-79. Liability on revenue certificates; tax exemption
Neither the members of an authority nor any person executing certificates on behalf of an authority shall be personally liable thereon by reason of the issuance thereof. The certificates and other obligations of an authority shall not be, and shall so state on the face thereof, a debt of the city, the county, the state or any political subdivision thereof, or any combination of subdivisions acting jointly as provided in this article. Certificates of any authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt from all taxes.

Certificates of an authority shall be authorized by its resolution and may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates; mature at such time or times; bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding 9 percent per annum; be in such denomination or denominations; be in such form, either coupon or registered; carry such conversion or registration privileges; have such rank or priority; be executed in such manner; be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places; and be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without premium, as such resolution, its trust indenture, or mortgage may provide. In the event that any of the members or officers of the authority whose signatures appear on any certificates or coupons shall cease to be such members or officers before the delivery of such certificates, such signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes.

              <p>In the event that the payments to be made by any city or county, under contract entered into between the authority and the subdivision, are pledged to the security or payment of revenue certificates sought to be validated, the hospital authority, as an integral part of the validation proceedings, shall have a right of action against the contracting subdivision or subdivisions for a declaratory adjudication of the validity and binding effect of the contract, the actual controversy therein being whether or not the contract is in all respects valid and binding upon the subdivision or subdivisions. The subdivision or subdivisions shall be made a party or parties to the action, and it shall be incumbent on the subdivisions to defend against an adjudication of the validity of such contract or be forever bound. Notice of the proceedings shall be included in the notice of validation hearing required to be issued and published by the clerk of the superior court in which such validation proceeding is pending. Any citizen resident in any subdivision which is a party to the contract may intervene in the validation proceedings at or before the time set for the validation hearing by order of the superior court and assert any ground or objection to the validity and binding effect of the contract on his own behalf and on behalf of the subdivision and all citizens, residents, and property owners thereof. An adjudication as to the validity of the contract, unexcepted to within the time provided for exceptions in Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36, shall be conclusive and binding upon the subdivision or subdivisions and the resident citizens and property owners thereof.

            <p>§ 31-7-82. Enforcement of rights of revenue certificate holders; procedure in event of default
Obligations of an authority evidenced by certificates and trust indentures and mortgages executed in connection therewith may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by the authority. The authority may in such instruments provide for pledging of all or any part of its gross or net fees, tolls, charges, revenues, and incomes and for mortgaging of all or any part of its real or personal property and may covenant against pledging any or all of its income, revenues, tolls, charges, or fees; and the authority may further provide for the disposition of proceeds realized from the sale of any mutilated certificates and necessary provisions as to payment and redemption of such certificates. Undertakings of an authority may likewise prescribe the procedure by which certificate holders may enforce rights against the authority and provide for such rights upon breach of any covenant, condition, or obligation of the authority. Trust indentures, mortgages, or deeds to secure debt executed by an authority may provide that, in the event of default by the authority in the payment of principal and interest on certificates or obligations or breach of any covenant, a trustee or trustees appointed under the terms of the indenture, mortgage, or deed to secure debt, which shall be a bank or trust company authorized to exercise trust powers, may take possession of and use, operate, and manage any project mortgaged as security for the repayment of any indebtedness of the authority and provide the terms and conditions upon which the trustee or trustees or holders of certificates may enforce any right relating to such certificates. Such trust indentures, mortgages, and deeds to secure debt may contain such provisions, not inconsistent with law, as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the authority.

Pending use for the purpose for which received, each hospital authority created by and under this article is authorized and empowered to invest all moneys or any part thereof received through the issuance and sale of revenue certificates of the authority in any securities which are legal investments or which are provided for in the trust indenture securing such certificates or other legal investments; provided, however, that such investments will be used at all times while held, or upon sale, for the purposes for which the money was originally received and no other. Contributions or gifts received by any authority shall be invested as provided by the terms of the contribution or gift or in the absence thereof as determined by the authority.

            <p>§ 31-7-89. Procedure for dissolution; disposition of property
By joint action of the board of trustees of an authority and the governing bodies of participating units, authorities created under and pursuant to the terms of this article may be dissolved, provided that no such dissolution shall in any way impair the rights of third persons or the contracts of the authority with such third persons.

              <p>The General Assembly finds that hospital authorities and rural hospital organizations are essential in order to promote public health goals of the state. The General Assembly further finds that many rural hospital organizations are in desperate financial straits. In order to preserve the availability of primary health care services provided by such hospitals to residents of rural counties, the General Assembly has determined that a program of state grants is necessary and recommends funds be made available to such hospitals. These grants will be conditioned upon those hospitals continuing to furnish essential health care services to residents in their areas of operation as well as engaging in the long-range planning and any restructuring which may be required for those hospitals to survive by devising cost-effective and efficient health care systems for meeting local health care needs.</p>

            <p>§ 31-7-115. Lease or sale of projects
No project acquired under this article shall be operated by an authority, any municipal corporation, county, or other governmental subdivision; but such projects shall be leased or sold to one or more qualified sponsors. If revenue bonds or other obligations are to be issued to pay all or part of the cost of such project, the project must be so leased or the contract for its sale entered into prior to or simultaneously with the issuance of such bonds or obligations unless the proceeds of the revenue bonds or other obligations are to be loaned to a qualified sponsor in connection with the development of a project, in which case an appropriate loan agreement shall be entered into prior to or simultaneously with the issuance of such bonds or obligations. If the project is sold, the purchase price may be paid at one time or in installments falling due over not more than 40 years from the date of transfer of possession. The lessee or purchaser shall be required to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the leased or purchased property and to pay rentals or installments in amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest and premium, if any, on all of its bonds and other obligations as the principal and interest become due.

Such instruments may provide for the pledging of all or any part of the revenues of the authority and for the mortgaging, encumbering, or conveying of all or any part of its real or personal property; may covenant against pledging any or all of its revenues, income, or charges; and may further provide for the disposition of proceeds realized from the sale of any bonds and bond anticipation notes, for the replacement of lost, destroyed, stolen, or mutilated bonds and notes and for the payment and redemption of such bonds and notes. Undertakings of an authority may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders and noteholders may enforce rights against the authority and may provide for rights upon breach of any covenant, condition, or obligation of the authority. Bonds, resolutions, trust indentures, mortgages, or deeds to secure obligations executed by an authority and bond anticipation notes executed by an authority may contain such provisions not otherwise contrary to law as the authority shall deem necessary or desirable.</p>

The authority may issue notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated.

Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of such notes, but it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated.

The confidentiality provisions of this article shall also apply to any proceedings, records, actions, activities, evidence, findings, recommendations, evaluations, opinions, data, or other information shared between review organizations which are performing a peer review function or disclosed to a governmental agency as required by law. However, information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as immune from discovery or use in any such civil action merely because they were presented during proceedings of such organization, nor should any person who testifies before such organization or who is a member of such organization be prevented from testifying as to matters within such person's knowledge; but such witness cannot be asked about such witness's testimony before such organization or about opinions formed by such witness as a result of the organization hearings.

            <p>§ 31-7-150. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Branch office" means a location or site, identified in the application or endorsement thereto, from which a home health agency provides services within a portion of the total geographic area served by the parent agency and which is part of the home health agency and is located sufficiently close to share administration, supervision, and services in a manner that renders it unnecessary for the branch independently to meet the requirements of this article.

(1.1)  "Department" means the Department of Community Health.

(2)  "Home health agency" means a public, nonprofit, or proprietary organization, whether owned or operated by one or more persons or legal entities, which is engaged in furnishing home health services.(3)  "Home health services" means those items and services furnished to an individual according to a written plan of treatment signed by the patient's physician, by a home health agency, or by others under arrangement with the home health agency, on a visit or hourly basis, in a place of temporary or permanent residence used as the individual's home, as follows:
(A)  Part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care as ordered by a physician and provided by or under the supervision of a registered nurse and at least one other service listed in subparagraphs (B) through (D) of this paragraph;

(B)  Physical, occupational, or speech therapy;

(C)  Medical social services; and

(D)  Home health aide services.

(4)  "License" means a license issued by the department.

(5)  "Licensee" means the individual, corporation, or public entity with whom rests the ultimate responsibility for maintaining approved standards for the home health agency.

(6)  "Parent home health agency" means the agency that develops and maintains administrative controls of subunits or branch offices.

(7)  "Physician" means an individual currently licensed or authorized to practice medicine, surgery, or osteopathy in this state.

(8)  "Plan of treatment" means a plan written, signed, and reviewed at least every two months by the patient's physician prescribing items and services for the patient's condition.

(9)  "Registered nurse" means an individual who is currently licensed as a registered professional nurse in this state.

(10)  "Subunit" means a semiautonomous organization which serves patients in a geographic area different from that of the parent agency and which, by virtue of the distance between it and the parent agency, is judged incapable of sharing administration, supervision, and services on a daily basis with the parent agency and must, therefore, independently meet the licensing requirements for a home health agency and shall be separately licensed.

            <p>§ 31-7-172. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Advanced and progressive disease" means a serious life-threatening medical condition which is irreversible and which will continue indefinitely, where there is no reasonable hope of recovery, but where the patient's medical prognosis is one in which there is a life expectancy of up to two years. This term does not include terminally ill patients as defined in paragraph (12) of this Code section.

(2)  "Bereavement services" means the supportive services provided to the family unit to assist it in coping with the patient's death, including follow-up assessment and assistance through the first year after death.

(4)  "Health care facility" means hospitals; other special care units, including but not limited to podiatric facilities; skilled nursing facilities; intermediate care facilities; assisted living communities; personal care homes; ambulatory surgical or obstetrical facilities; health maintenance organizations; home health agencies; and diagnostic, treatment, or rehabilitation centers.

(5)  "Hospice" means a public agency or private organization or unit of either providing to persons terminally ill and to their families, regardless of ability to pay, a centrally administered and autonomous continuum of palliative and supportive care, directed and coordinated by the hospice care team primarily in the patient's home but also on an outpatient and short-term inpatient basis and which is classified as hospice by the department. In addition, such public agency or private organization or unit of either may also provide palliative care to persons with advanced and progressive diseases and to their families, directed and coordinated by the hospice care team.

(6)  "Hospice care" means both regularly scheduled care and care available on a 24 hour on-call basis, consisting of medical, nursing, social, spiritual, volunteer, and bereavement services substantially all of which are provided to the patient and to the patient's family regardless of ability to pay under a written care plan established and periodically reviewed by the patient's attending physician, by the medical director of the hospice program, and by the hospice care team.

(7)  "Hospice care team" means an interdisciplinary working unit composed of members of the various helping professions (who may donate their professional services), including but not limited to: a physician licensed or authorized to practice in this state, a registered professional nurse, a social worker, a member of the clergy or other counselor, and volunteers who provide hospice care.

(8)  "Hospice patient family unit" means the terminally ill person or person with an advanced and progressive disease and his or her family, which may include spouse, children, siblings, parents, and other relatives with significant personal ties to the patient.

(9)  "License" means a license issued by the department.

(10)  "Palliative care" means those interventions by the hospice care team which are intended to alleviate suffering and to achieve relief from, reduction of, or elimination of pain and of other physical, emotional, social, or spiritual symptoms of distress to achieve the best quality of life for the patients and their families.

(11)  "Patient" means a terminally ill individual receiving the hospice continuum of services, regardless of ability to pay, and also means an individual with an advanced and progressive disease.

(12)  "Terminally ill" means that the individual is experiencing an illness for which therapeutic intervention directed toward cure of the disease is no longer appropriate, and the patient's medical prognosis is one in which there is a life expectancy of six months or less.

Since hospice care is primarily provided at home, licensure shall not be determined solely on the number of inpatient beds needed for service. Inpatient beds under contract to a hospice program may be used by the hospice when needed but may remain otherwise available to the inpatient unit at other times without a change in licensing.

Such information shall include but not be limited to any information the licensee may have regarding preliminary or fingerprint records check determinations regarding that director. After receiving a change of director notification, the department shall make a written determination from the information furnished with such notification and the department's own records as to whether a satisfactory or unsatisfactory preliminary or fingerprint records check determination has ever been made for the newly designated director. If the department determines that such director within 12 months prior thereto has had a fingerprint records check determination that is satisfactory, such determination shall be deemed to be a satisfactory fingerprint records check determination as to that director. The license of that facility shall not be adversely affected by that change in director and the licensee shall be so notified. The time frames set forth in this subsection shall not apply when fingerprints have been retained by the department due to its participation in the program described in subparagraph</p>

            <p>§ 31-7-263. (Repealed effective October 1, 2019) Contested cases for purposes of the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act."
A determination by the department regarding preliminary or fingerprint records checks under this article or any action by the department revoking, suspending, or refusing to grant or renew a license based upon such determination shall constitute a contested case for purposes of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," except that any hearing required to be held pursuant thereto may be held reasonably expeditiously after such determination or action by the department. It is expressly provided that upon motion from any party, the hearing officer may, in his discretion, consider matters in mitigation of any conviction, provided the hearing officer examines the circumstances of the case and makes an independent finding that no physical harm was done to a victim and also examines the character and employment history since the conviction and determines that there is no propensity for cruel behavior or behavior involving moral turpitude on the part of the person making a motion for an exception to sanctions normally imposed. If the hearing officer deems a hearing to be appropriate, he will also notify at least 30 days prior to such hearing the office of the prosecuting attorney who initiated the prosecution of the case in question in order to allow the prosecutor to object to a possible determination that the conviction would not be a bar for the grant or continuation of a license or employment as contemplated within this title.  If objections are made, the hearing officer will take such objections into consideration in considering the case.  If the hearing officer determines that no hearing in mitigation is justified, or, if after the hearing, rules against the party seeking mitigation, then in either of those events the hearing officer's determinations shall be conclusive and final and not subject to further review.

          <content>
            <p>§ 31-7-406. Purpose of public hearing; factors to be addressed in disclosureThe purpose of the public hearing shall be to ensure that the public's interest is protected when the assets of a nonprofit hospital are acquired by an acquiring entity by requiring full disclosure of the purpose and terms of the transaction and providing an opportunity for local public input. The disposition of a nonprofit hospital to an acquiring entity shall not be in the public interest unless there has been adequate disclosure that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that the transaction is authorized, to safeguard the value of charitable assets, and to ensure that any proceeds of the transaction are used for appropriate charitable health care purposes. Such disclosure shall address, at a minimum, the following factors:
(1)  Whether the disposition is permitted under Chapter 3 of Title 14, the "Georgia Nonprofit Corporation Code," and other laws of Georgia governing nonprofit entities, trusts, or charities;

(2)  Whether the disposition is consistent with the directives of major donors who have contributed over $100,000.00;

(3)  Whether the governing body of the nonprofit corporation exercised due diligence in deciding to dispose of hospital assets, selecting the acquiring entity, and negotiating the terms and conditions of the disposition;

(4)  The procedures used by the nonprofit corporation in making its decision to dispose of its assets, including whether appropriate expert assistance was used;

(5)  Whether any conflict of interest was disclosed, including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest related to directors or officers of the nonprofit corporation and experts retained by the parties to the transaction;

(6)  Whether the seller or lessor will receive fair value for its assets, including an appropriate control premium for any relinquishment of control or, in the case of a proposed disposition to a not for profit entity, will receive an enforceable commitment for fair and reasonable community benefits for its assets;

(7)  Whether charitable assets are placed at unreasonable risk if the transaction is financed in part by the seller or lessor;

(8)  Whether the terms of any management or services contract negotiated in conjunction with the transaction are reasonable;

(9)  Whether any disposition proceeds will be used for appropriate charitable health care purposes consistent with the nonprofit corporation's original purpose or for the support and promotion of health care in the affected community;

(10)  Whether a meaningful right of first refusal to repurchase the assets by a successor nonprofit corporation or foundation has been retained if the acquiring entity subsequently proposes to sell, lease, or transfer the hospital to yet another entity;

(11)  Whether sufficient safeguards are included to assure the affected community continued access to affordable care and to the range of services historically provided by the nonprofit corporation;

(12)  Whether the acquiring entity has made an enforceable commitment to provide health care to the disadvantaged, the uninsured, and the underinsured and to provide benefits to the affected community to promote improved health care; and

(13)  Whether health care providers will be offered the opportunity to invest or own an interest in the acquiring entity or a related party, and whether procedures or safeguards are in place to avoid conflict of interest in patient referrals.

In order to promote and preserve the health of the people of this state, there is established a Hospital Care for the Indigent Program to be administered by the Department of Community Health. The purpose of this program is to assist counties in the purchase of hospital care for persons who are ill or injured and who can be helped by treatment in a hospital but are financially unable to meet the full cost of hospital care from their own resources or from the resources of those upon whom they are legally dependent. The purchase of such hospital care shall be limited to the nonprofit basic cost of hospital care needed for the treatment of the ill or injured, as deemed necessary and ordered by the physician in charge of the case in accordance with this article and the rules, regulations, and standards adopted and promulgated pursuant to this article.

            <p>§ 31-8-30. Findings; purpose of article
The General Assembly finds that there is an inequitable distribution of the public costs incurred in providing health care for indigent persons who receive such care outside their counties of residence. The publicly supported hospitals providing such health care are frequently not reimbursed for the costs thereby incurred, which either increases the tax burden of citizens supporting such hospitals or increases the charges made to paying patients or causes a combination of both types of such increases. It is the purpose of this article to recognize and provide for the state's responsibility to assist in the payment of cost of care for nonresident indigent patients by providing procedures for the reimbursement of such costs from state funds.

On and after July 1, 1987, hospitals shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this article unless the General Assembly appropriates funds in an amount determined as the state-wide cost of care for nonresident indigent patients as provided for in Code Section 31-8-36.

          <content>
            <p>§ 31-8-40. Legislative findings and purposeThe General Assembly finds that Georgia's high rates of infant mortality and morbidity are costly to the state in terms of human suffering and of expenditures for long-term institutionalization, special education, and medical care. It is well documented that appropriate care during pregnancy and delivery can prevent many of the expensive, disabling problems our children experience. The State of Georgia is making progress in improving services and funding. However, the General Assembly is concerned that some women continue to be refused service for financial reasons at hospitals when they request admission after labor has begun. It is the purpose of this article to assure that:
(1)  No hospital denies available, appropriate emergency services to a woman who has not made prior arrangements for the payment of the delivery and who seeks hospital care for the safe delivery of her child;

(2)  Counties assume a share of the responsibility in meeting this critical need for their residents who receive such care when no other source of payment from public or private sources is available; and

(3)  Women receiving such care and other persons specified in this article assume certain responsibilities with regard to payment for such care after it is rendered, but it is not the purpose of this article to establish a general health insurance program for all pregnant indigent women.

          <content>
            <p>§ 31-8-42. Requirement of hospitals with emergency services to provide care to pregnant women in laborAny hospital which operates an emergency service shall be required to provide the appropriate, necessary emergency services to any pregnant woman who is a resident of this state and who presents herself in active labor to the hospital, if those services are usually and customarily provided in that facility, which services shall be provided within the scope of generally accepted practice based upon the information furnished the hospital by the pregnant woman, including such information as the pregnant woman reveals concerning her prenatal care, diet, allergies, previous births, general health information, and other such information as the pregnant woman may furnish the hospital. If, in the medical judgment of the physician responsible for the emergency service, the hospital must transfer the patient because the hospital is unable to provide appropriate treatment, the hospital where the patient has presented herself shall:
(1)  Within the capabilities of the hospital provide such emergency services as the circumstances require, which services shall be provided within the scope of generally accepted practice based upon the information furnished the hospital by the pregnant woman, including such information as the pregnant woman reveals concerning her prenatal care, diet, allergies, previous births, general health information, and other such information as the pregnant woman may furnish the hospital;

(2)  Contact an appropriate receiving hospital and notify such hospital that the patient is in transit;

(3)  Arrange suitable transportation for the patient if necessary; and

(4)  Send to the receiving hospital any available information on the patient's history and condition.

The transfer shall not be authorized until the physician considers the patient sufficiently stabilized for transport.

Such notification shall include a certification by the chief administrative officer of the hospital that an appropriate investigation has been made and that it has been determined that no portion of the cost of services may be paid by the medical assistance program for the needy under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, by insurance, or by any other governmental or public agency pursuant to any federal, state, or local program or a certification that an appropriate investigation has been made and that a portion of the cost of services may be paid from such sources. If it is determined that a portion of the cost of services may be paid from such sources, then the notification shall include a certification of the amount which may be so paid.

            <p>§ 31-8-50. Declaration of policy
The General Assembly finds that a significant number of older citizens of this state reside in long-term care facilities in this state and, because of their isolated and vulnerable condition, are more dependent on others for their protection and care. It is the intent of the General Assembly to protect and improve the quality of care and life for residents through the promotion of community involvement in long-term care facilities and by the establishment of a process to resolve complaints and problems of residents. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that the department, within available resources and pursuant to its duties under the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, ensure that the quality of care and life for such residents is maintained, that necessary reports are made and that, where necessary, corrective action is taken at the departmental level.

            <p>§ 31-8-52. Establishment of long-term care ombudsman program
Pursuant to the Older Americans Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-73, 79 Stat. 219), as amended, and as a condition of receiving funds under that act for various programs for older citizens of this state, the Department of Human Services has been required to establish and operate a long-term care ombudsman program. In order to receive such funds, the department has already established a position of state ombudsman within the state Office of Special Programs. The state ombudsman shall be under the direct supervision of the commissioner of human services or his or her designee and shall be given the powers and duties hereafter provided by this article. The state ombudsman shall be a person qualified by training and experience in the field of aging or long-term care, or both. The state ombudsman shall promote the well-being and quality of life of residents in long-term care facilities and encourage the development of community ombudsman activities at the local level. The state ombudsman may certify community ombudsmen and such certified ombudsmen shall have the powers and duties set forth in Code Sections 31-8-54 and 31-8-55. The state ombudsman shall require such community ombudsmen to receive appropriate training as determined and approved by the department prior to certification. Such training shall include an internship of at least seven working days in a nursing home and at least three working days in a personal care home. Upon certification, the state ombudsman shall issue an identification card which shall be presented upon request by community ombudsmen whenever needed to carry out the purposes of this article. Two years after first being certified and every two years thereafter, each such community ombudsman, in order to carry out his or her duties under this article, shall be recertified by the state ombudsman as continuing to meet the department's standards as community ombudsman.

              <p>Following an investigation, the state ombudsman or community ombudsman shall report his opinions or recommendations to the party or parties affected thereby and shall attempt to resolve the complaint using, whenever possible, informal techniques of mediation, conciliation, and persuasion. With respect to a complaint against the long-term care facility, the ombudsman shall first notify the administrator of the facility in writing and give such administrator a reasonable opportunity to correct any alleged defect. If the administrator fails to take corrective action after a reasonable amount of time or if the defect seriously threatens the safety or well-being of the residents, the state ombudsman or community ombudsman may refer the complaint to an appropriate agency.</p>

The identities of the resident, the alleged perpetrator, and persons making a report or providing information or evidence shall not be disclosed to the public unless required to be revealed in court proceedings or upon the written consent of the person whose identity is to be revealed or as otherwise required by law. Upon the resident's or his or her representative's request, the department shall make information obtained in an abuse report or complaint and an investigation available to an allegedly abused or exploited resident or his or her representative for inspection or duplication, except that such disclosure shall be made without revealing the identity of any other resident, the person making the report, or persons providing information by name or inference. For the purpose of this Code section, the term "representative" shall include any person authorized in writing by the resident or appointed by an appropriate court to act upon the resident's behalf. The term "representative" also shall include a family member of a deceased or physically or mentally impaired resident unable to grant authorization; provided, however, that such family members who do not have written or court authorization shall not be authorized by this Code section to receive the resident's health records as defined in Code Section 31-33-1. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to deny agencies participating in joint investigations at the request of and with the department, or conducting separate investigations of abuse or exploitation within an agency's scope of authority, or law enforcement personnel who are conducting an investigation into any criminal offense in which a resident is a victim from having access to such records.

            <p>§ 31-8-101. Legislative intent
The General Assembly finds that persons residing within long-term care facilities are isolated from the community and often lack the means to assert fully their rights as individual citizens. The General Assembly further recognizes the need for these persons to live within the least restrictive environment possible in order to retain their individuality and personal freedom. It is therefore the intent of the General Assembly to preserve the dignity and personal integrity of residents of long-term care facilities through the recognition and declaration of rights safeguarding against encroachments upon each resident's need for self-determination. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that this article complement and not duplicate or substitute for other survey and inspection programs regarding long-term care facilities.

            <p>§ 31-8-131. Legislative findings and intent
The General Assembly finds that persons residing within personal care homes are often isolated from the community and often lack the means to assert fully their rights as individual citizens.  The General Assembly also recognizes that in order for the rights of residents of personal care homes to be fully protected, residents must be afforded a means of recourse when such rights have been denied.  It is therefore the intent of the General Assembly to preserve the dignity and personal integrity of residents of personal care homes by providing access to a legal process to hear and redress the grievances of such residents regarding their individual rights.

            <p>§ 31-8-191. Legislative findings and intent
The General Assembly finds that a significant proportion of the residents of this state who are uninsured or Medicaid recipients are unable to access needed health care because health care providers fear the increased risk of medical negligence liability. It is the intent of the General Assembly that access to medical care for indigent residents be improved by providing governmental protection to health care providers who offer free quality medical services to underserved populations of the state. Therefore, it is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that health care professionals who contract to provide such services as agents of the state are provided sovereign immunity.
