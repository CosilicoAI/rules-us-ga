          <p>(a.1)If the board of trustees determines by clear and convincing evidence presented to the board by or on behalf of the member that the disability itself was the cause of failure to file a timely application for disability retirement, the board of trustees is authorized to calculate the annual benefit provided for in subsection (c) of this Code section as if the member had retired on such effective date of disability retirement increased by any increases in benefits which the member would have received if he or she had retired on that date and adjust the benefits of such retiree as of the first of the month following such determination; provided, however, that the board of trustees is not authorized to pay retroactive disability benefits. This subsection applies to former members who became disabled at any time prior to July 1, 1996, as well as to former members who become disabled on or after July 1, 1996.</p>
