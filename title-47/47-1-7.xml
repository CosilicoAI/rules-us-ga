          <p>The board of trustees or other person or body having the power to manage, invest, and reinvest the assets of any retirement, pension, or emeritus system or fund created under the laws of this state may authorize any agent, including a bank or trust company, employed to act as custodian of such assets or to act as an investment adviser and to make investments for such retirement, pension, or emeritus system or fund, provided that such agent has a nominee or nominees in whose name securities, including, without limitation, bonds, stocks, notes, and other evidence of title to intangible personal property, held by the agent may be registered, to register securities which are held under the terms of such agency in the name of the nominee or nominees, without mention of the agency relationship in the instrument evidencing such securities or on the books of the issuing entity. The records of such agent shall at all times clearly show that such securities are held in such agency capacity and shall indicate the beneficial owner of the securities. Such agent shall not be relieved of liability for the safe custody, control, and proper distribution of such securities or the income therefrom by reason of the registration of those securities in the name of any nominee. The authorization of any such agent to register securities in the name of such nominees shall be in writing and may contain such other restrictions as the board of trustees or other person or body charged with the management and investment of the assets of any such retirement, pension, or emeritus system or fund may deem appropriate.</p>
