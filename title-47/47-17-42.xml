          <p>Any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any person who was totally blinded in the line of duty as a peace officer prior to the creation of the fund and who has been unable to serve as a peace officer since that injury is authorized to become a member of the fund, regardless of whether such person is now or hereafter a peace officer. If he elects to join the fund, he shall pay into it the amount which he would have paid had he joined the fund upon its creation and continued as a member since that time, which amount shall be determined by the board. Upon such payment he shall be authorized to receive the maximum disability benefits under Code Section 47-17-81 without the necessity of complying with any time limitations contained in that Code section.</p>
