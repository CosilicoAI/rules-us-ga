          <p>"NOTICE REQUIRED BY STATE</p>
          <p>LAW REGARDING DISCLOSURES</p>
          <p>State law requires that a multilevel distribution company shall make available certain disclosures regarding the company prior to obtaining participants.

This will be the only notice you receive regarding your rights to see these disclosures. If you waive these rights, you are giving up an important consumer protection that the State of Georgia has found you should be provided. If you wish to exercise these rights, please indicate below that you want to see the disclosures before agreeing to be a participant, then do not agree to become a participant until the disclosures have been made available to you.
