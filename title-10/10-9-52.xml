          <p>Any holder of revenue bonds or interest coupons thereon issued under this article, any receiver for such holders, or any indenture trustee, if there is any, except to the extent the rights given in this article may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted under this article or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this article or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof. In the event of default upon the principal and interest or other obligations of any revenue bond issue, any such holder, receiver, or indenture trustee shall be subrogated to each and every right of collecting rentals, revenues, earnings, or funds by the authority which the authority may possess under contracts designated as security therefor, and, in the pursuit of its remedies as subrogee, may proceed either at law or in equity by action, mandamus, or other proceedings to collect any sums by such proceeding due and owing to the authority and pledged or partially pledged to the benefit of the revenue bond issue. No individual, receiver, or indenture trustee thereof shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state to pay any such revenue bond or the interest thereon or otherwise to enforce the payment thereof against the state or the authority or any property of the state or authority, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon the property of the state or authority except the rents, revenues, earnings, and funds designated as security for the revenue bonds. In addition to the foregoing, the resolution or trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders subject to the limitations otherwise stated in this article. All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of the project affected by the indenture.</p>
