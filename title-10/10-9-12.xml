          <p>The authority, in addition to the moneys received from the collection of revenues, rents, and earnings derived under the provisions of this chapter or from the Department of Economic Development, shall have authority to accept from any entity or agency of the United States, of this state, or of any county, municipality, political subdivision, or public authority and from any private individual or entity, grants, contributions, or gifts of either money or property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, or services or other things of value, in the furtherance of the purposes and powers of the authority. Incident to the acceptance of any such grant, contribution, or gift, the authority may accept and bind itself to express terms and conditions imposed incident to the grant, contribution, or gift governing the use and application of the money or property or the use of disposition of any property acquired therewith, provided that such term or condition is expressly accepted by the authority, is consistent with the purposes and powers of the authority under this chapter, and is not inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of this state. Any such term or condition may require the authority to hold any money or property in trust separate from other money or property of the authority and any such money or property so held shall not be subject to any claims against or liability of the authority not arising from the use or application of the money or property so held or the operation of the property so held or acquired therewith.</p>
