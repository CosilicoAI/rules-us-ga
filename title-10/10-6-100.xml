          <p>Any person, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity which engages in the business of receiving cash from patrons as payment of obligations owed by such patrons to third parties, with the understanding that such person, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity will act as agent of the patron in making payment directly to the third party must, as a condition to engaging in such a business, post a bond as security in the amount of $50,000.00 with the clerk of the superior court in the county in which its principal place of business is located; provided, however, that no such bonding requirement need be met by any person, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity who or which handles or administers fewer than 20 payments per month; provided, further, that no such bonding requirement need be met by any person, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity who or which has received written authorization from a third party to act as agent for the third party. Written authorization to the agent from one or more third parties does not relieve the agent from posting the security bond as required by this Code section if the agent is receiving 20 or more cash payments owed to one or more other third parties from whom no written authorization has been received.</p>
          <p>(Code 1933, § 84-6901, enacted by Ga. L. 1976, p. 558, § 1.)</p>
