          <p>Unless the articles of association expressly provide otherwise, a professional association shall continue as a separate entity independent of its members or shareholders, for all purposes for such period of time as provided in the articles, or until dissolved by a vote of two-thirds of the members. An association shall continue notwithstanding the death, insanity, incompetency, conviction for felony, resignation, withdrawal, transfer of membership or ownership of shares, retirement, or expulsion of any one or more of the members or shareholders; the admission of or transfer of membership or shares to any new member or members or shareholder or shareholders; or the happening of any other event, which under the law of this state and under like circumstances would work a dissolution of a partnership, it being the aim and intention of this Code section that such professional association shall have continuity of life independent of the life or status of its members or shareholders. No member or shareholder of a professional association shall have the power to dissolve the association by his independent act of any kind.</p>
