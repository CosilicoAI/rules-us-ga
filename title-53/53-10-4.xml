          <p>If any stocks, bonds, bank deposits, or other intangible property shall be owned so that one of two joint owners is entitled to the whole on the death of the other and both owners die and there is no sufficient evidence that the two joint owners have died otherwise than simultaneously, these assets shall be distributed one-half as if one joint owner had survived and one-half as if the other joint owner had survived. If there are more than two joint owners and there is no sufficient evidence that all have died other than simultaneously, these assets shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are joint owners and these portions shall be distributed respectively to those who would have taken in the event that each joint owner had survived.</p>
