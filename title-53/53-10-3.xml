          <p>If property is so disposed of that the right of a beneficiary to succeed to any interest in such property is conditional upon surviving another individual and both individuals die and there is no sufficient evidence that the two have died other than simultaneously, the beneficiary shall be deemed not to have survived. If there is no sufficient evidence that two or more beneficiaries have died otherwise than simultaneously and property has been disposed of in such a way that at the time of their deaths each beneficiary would have been entitled to the property if that beneficiary had survived the others, the property shall be divided into as many equal portions as there were such beneficiaries and these portions shall be distributed respectively to those who would have taken in the event that each such beneficiary survived.</p>
