          <content>
            <p>§ 44-10-8. Recordation of easements; revaluation of encumbered property; appeals
A conservation easement may be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the land is located.

            <p>§ 44-10-21. Legislative purpose; intent
The General Assembly finds that the historical, cultural, and esthetic heritage of this state is among its most valued and important assets and that the preservation of this heritage is essential to the promotion of the health, prosperity, and general welfare of the people. Therefore, in order to stimulate the revitalization of central business districts in this state's municipalities, to protect and enhance this state's historical and esthetic attractions to tourists and visitors and thereby promote and stimulate business in this state's cities and counties, to encourage the acquisition by cities and counties of conservation easements pursuant to Code Sections 44-10-1 through 44-10-8, and to enhance the opportunities for federal tax relief of this state's property owners under the relevant provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 allowing tax deductions for rehabilitation of certified historic structures, the General Assembly establishes a uniform procedure for use by each county and municipality in the state in enacting ordinances providing for the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of places, districts, sites, buildings, structures, and works of art having a special historical, cultural, or esthetic interest or value.

A trespasser may not set off improvements in an action brought for mesne profits except when the value of the premises has been increased by the repairs or improvements which have been made. In that case, the jury may take into consideration the improvements or repairs and may diminish the profits by that amount but not below the sum which the premises would have been worth without such improvements or repairs.

The Attorney General, by written notice prior to the return date on which an answer or similar pleading is due or any extension thereof is secured by the holder, but in any event in reasonably sufficient time for the holder to comply with the directions received, shall either direct the holder actively to defend in the proceedings or direct that no defense be entered into the proceedings.

              <p>All abandoned property, other than money delivered to the commissioner under this article, shall, within three years after the delivery, be sold by him to the highest bidder at public sale in whatever city in the state affords, in his judgment, the most favorable market for the property involved.

He need not offer any property for sale if, in his opinion, the probable cost of the sale exceeds the value of the property.</p>

All funds received under this article, including the proceeds from the sale of abandoned property under Code Section 44-12-217, shall be deposited by the commissioner in the general fund; provided, however, that the commissioner may deduct moneys necessary to cover the direct administrative expenses required to identify, locate, secure, and transmit abandoned property prior to depositing such funds. Before making a deposit he or she shall record the name and last known address of each person appearing from the holders' reports to be entitled to the abandoned property and of the name and last known address of each insured person or annuitant and, with respect to each policy or contract listed in the report of an insurance corporation, its number, the name of the corporation, and the amount due.

            <p>§ 44-12-219. When commissioner may decline to receive certain property
The commissioner, after receiving reports of property deemed abandoned pursuant to this article, may decline to receive any property reported which he deems to have a value less than the cost of giving notice and holding sale, or he may, if he deems it desirable because of the small sum involved, postpone taking possession until a sufficient sum accumulates. Unless the holder of the property is notified to the contrary within 120 days after filing the report required under Code Section 44-12-214, the commissioner shall be deemed to have elected to receive the custody of the property.

            <p>§ 44-13-101. Method of obtaining exemption
Every debtor seeking the benefit of Code Section 44-13-100 or, if he refuses, his wife or any person acting as her next friend shall make out a schedule of the property claimed to be exempt and shall return the schedule to the judge of the probate court of the county without making any application for homestead; and it shall not be necessary to publish the schedule in a newspaper. The judge shall record the schedule in a book to be kept by him for that purpose; and, when land out of his county is exempted, he shall transmit the schedule to the judge of the probate court of the county in which the land is located for recording in like manner.

            <p>§ 44-13-103. Objections to survey or to valuation of improvements; application to probate court; appointment of appraisers; alterations in survey
Should any creditor, for any cause, desire to dispute the propriety of the survey or the value of the improvements, he may make application to the judge of the probate court and give notice to the debtor thereof. Thereafter, the judge may appoint three appraisers to view the survey and to value the improvements; and, on their return, the judge may direct the surveyor to make such alterations as shall, in his judgment, be conformable to law. It shall be a valid ground of objection to the propriety of any survey that the same has been so made by a disregard of the shape and location of the entire tract as to injure unjustly or needlessly the value of any land left unexempted.

            <p>§ 44-14-4. Procedure for recording cancellation of mortgage
Any mortgagor who has paid off his or her mortgage may present the paid mortgage to the clerk of the superior court of the county or counties in which the mortgage instrument is recorded, together with the order of the mortgagee or transferee directing that the mortgage be canceled. After payment of the fee authorized by law, the clerk shall index and record, in the same manner as the original mortgage instrument is recorded, the canceled and satisfied mortgage instrument or such portion thereof as bears the order of the mortgagee or transferee directing that the mortgage be canceled, together with any order of the mortgagee or transferee directing that the mortgage be canceled. The clerk shall show on the index of the cancellation and on the cancellation document the deed book and page number where the original mortgage instrument is recorded. The clerk shall manually or through electronic means record across the face of the mortgage instrument the words "satisfied" and "canceled" and the date of the entry and shall sign his or her name thereto officially. The clerk shall also manually or electronically make a notation on the record of the mortgage to indicate where the order of the cancellation is recorded.

          <content>

A mortgage or bill of sale to secure debt may embrace all property in possession, or to which the mortgagor or grantor has the right of possession at the time. A mortgage or bill of sale to secure debt given by a person or a corporation to a trustee or trustees to secure an issue of bonds shall, when it is expressly so stipulated therein, embrace, cover, and convey title to after-acquired property of such person or corporation. Provided, however, any public utility company, whether or not incorporated, including, without limitation, any corporation organized under or governed by the provisions of Article 4 of Chapter 3 of Title 46, may by mortgage, bill of sale to secure debt, deed to secure debt, or deed of trust, embrace, cover, convey, pledge, and encumber after-acquired property of such company, wherever located, when the instrument expressly so stipulates therein; and any such instrument when recorded as provided by law shall constitute notice from the time it is filed for record and shall have priority (subject to purchase money encumbrances) as against the interests of third parties with respect to after-acquired property from the time such property is acquired.

            <p>§ 44-14-124. Judgment; lien thereof; levy and sale of the land
When the maker of the deed, after being directed so to do, fails to pay the sums demanded in the petition together with interest and costs as required by Code Section 44-14-120 and also fails to set up and sustain his or her defense against the enforcement of the rights of the trustee and the holders or owners of the bonds, notes, or debts secured by the deed, the court shall give judgment for the amounts which may be due under the deed to be levied on the real property covered thereby. Upon the trustees making and recording a deed reconveying the real property to the maker in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the land is located, the court shall order the real property to be sold in the same manner and under the same regulations which govern sheriff's sales under execution; provided, however, that, if the deed is filed and recorded as provided by law, the judgment shall be a lien upon the real property which shall be superior to any claim or lien, except taxes, whatsoever arising or created subsequent to the date of the deed to the trustee.

(8)  "Condominium instruments" means the declaration and plats and plans recorded pursuant to this article. Any exhibit, schedule, or certification accompanying a condominium instrument and recorded simultaneously therewith shall be deemed an integral part of that condominium instrument. Any amendment or certification of any condominium instrument shall, from the time of the recordation of such amendment or certification, be deemed an integral part of the affected condominium instrument so long as such amendment or certification was made in accordance with this article.

(9)  "Condominium unit" means a unit, as defined in paragraph (28) of this Code section, together with the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to that unit.

(10)  "Conversion condominium" means a condominium all or part of which may be used for residential purposes, which condominium contains any building or portion thereof that at any time before the recording of the declaration was occupied wholly or partially by persons other than persons who, at the time of the recording, had contractual rights to acquire one or more units within the condominium. This paragraph shall not apply to any condominium created prior to July 1, 1980, or to the expansion of any such condominium.

(12)  "Court" means the superior court of the county where the condominium or any part thereof is located.

(13)  "Declarant" means all owners and lessees of the property who execute the declaration or on whose behalf the declaration is executed; provided, however, that the phrase "owner and lessees," as used in this Code section and in Code Sections 44-3-72 and 44-3-89, shall not include in his capacity as such any mortgagee, any lienholder, any person having an equitable interest under any contract for the sale or lease of a unit, or any lessee or tenant of a unit. From the time of the recordation of any amendment to the declaration expanding an expandable condominium, all persons who execute that amendment or on whose behalf that amendment is executed shall also come within the definition of "declarant." Any successor-in-title of any owner or lessee referred to in this paragraph who comes to stand in the same relation to the condominium as his predecessor did shall also come within such definition.

(14)  "Declaration" means the recordable instrument containing those matters required by Code Section 44-3-77 and any lawful amendments thereto.

(15)  "Expandable condominium" means a condominium to which additional property may be added in accordance with the declaration and this article.

              <p>Wherever this article requires a statement of a method for allocation or reallocation of undivided interests in the common elements, votes in the association, and the liability for common expenses, such method shall be so related to the physical characteristics of the units affected or otherwise so stated as to enable any person to determine the interest, vote, or share in such matters pertaining to any particular unit upon such allocation or reallocation. Certain spaces within the units, including, without limitation, attic, basement, and garage space, may but need not be omitted from such calculation or partially discounted by the use of a ratio so long as the same basis of calculation is employed for all units in the condominium. In the event that the declaration allocates or provides for the allocation to any unit of a different share of undivided interests in common elements than is allocated for liability for common expenses, such difference shall be based upon a good faith estimate of the declarant regarding the approximate relative maintenance or other costs occasioning such disparity, and the basis of such determination shall be stated in the declaration; provided, however, that no unit owner or other person may require any reallocation on account of any disparity between actual costs and the determination reflected in the declaration. Subject to the foregoing sentence of this subsection, nothing contained in this article shall be construed to require that the proportions of undivided interest in the common elements, of votes in the association, or of liability for common expenses assigned and allocated to each unit be equal, it being intended that such proportions may be independent.

              <p>The declarant of a conversion condominium shall deliver notice of the conversion to each tenant in possession of a unit which is subject to this article. The notice must be delivered at least 120 days before the declarant will require the tenant to vacate the unit. The notice must set forth generally the rights of tenants under this Code section. The tenant may not be required by the declarant to vacate the unit at any time during the 120 day period except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct which disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during said period; provided, however, that any notice which, under the terms of such tenancy, is required to be given to prevent the automatic renewal or extension of the term of such tenancy may be given during said period. Failure of the declarant to give notice as required by this Code section shall constitute a defense to an action by the declarant for possession initiated less than 120 days after proper delivery of such a notice.</p>

                <p>Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other provisions of this article, from and after July 1, 1990, no amendment of a condominium instrument shall require approval of unit owners to which more than 80 percent of the association vote pertains and the mortgagees holding 80 percent of the voting interest of mortgaged units; provided, however, that the provisions of any condominium instruments in effect on July 1, 1990, which provide for a majority in excess of 80 percent shall not be affected or modified by the provisions of this paragraph if by July 1, 1991, the association and those mortgagees permitted to vote on amendments voted by the majority required for an amendment as specified in the condominium instrument to retain the existing requirements for amendments; and provided, further, if no such vote by the required majority occurred, those provisions requiring more than 80 percent shall be deemed to require only 80 percent of the voting interest.  The approval of any proposed amendment by a mortgagee shall be deemed implied and consented to if the mortgagee fails to submit a response to any written proposal for an amendment within 30 days after the mortgagee receives notice of the proposed amendment sent by certified or registered mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested.

            <p>§ 44-3-94. Damage or destruction of units; restoration; vote not to restore; allocation of insurance deductible
Unless otherwise provided in the condominium instruments, in the event of damage to or destruction of any unit by a casualty covered under insurance required to be maintained by the association pursuant to Code Section 44-3-107, the association shall cause the unit to be restored. Unless otherwise provided in the condominium instruments, any funds required for such restoration in excess of the insurance proceeds attributable thereto shall be paid by the unit owner of the unit; provided, however, that, in the event that the unit owner of the unit together with the unit owners of other units to which two-thirds of the votes in the association pertain agree not to restore the unit, the unit shall not be restored and the entire undivided interest in the common elements pertaining to that unit shall then pertain to the remaining units, to be allocated to them in proportion to their undivided interests in the common elements, and the remaining portion of that unit shall thenceforth be a part of the common elements. Votes in the association and liability for future common expenses shall thereupon pertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their relative voting strength in the association and liability for common expenses, respectively. To the extent provided for in the condominium instruments, the association may allocate equitably the payment of a reasonable insurance deductible between the association and the unit owners affected by a casualty against which the association is required to insure; provided, however, that the amount of deductible which can be allocated to any one unit owner shall not exceed $5,000.00 per casualty loss covered under any insurance required to be maintained by the association under this article. The existence of a reasonable deductible in any required insurance policy shall not be deemed a failure to maintain insurance as required by this Code section.

If the declarant fails to cure any or all deficiencies identified in the notice within 30 days of such notice, then any owner, acting individually or jointly with other owners, shall have standing individually, and not solely through a derivative action, to institute an action in the superior court of the county in which any portion of the condominium is located in order to obtain a declaratory judgment to grant the owner or owners control of the association by ordering an election and setting the terms thereof, or issuing any other orders appropriate to transfer control of the association. The superior court shall have authority to hold a hearing and issue a summary ruling on said action at any time designated by the court not earlier than 20 days after the service thereof, unless the parties consent in writing to an earlier trial. No discovery shall be had unless ordered by the court for good cause. In addition, the superior court shall be authorized to issue a summary ruling on the conveyance of any intended common areas or other property in the common interest community to the association or other appropriate entity.

            <p>§ 44-3-110. Restraints on alienation and rights of first refusal; statement of waiver or failure to exercise rights or restraints; effect of failure to furnish statement
Any rights of first refusal or other restraints on free alienability of the condominium units created by the condominium instruments shall be void unless the condominium instruments make provision for furnishing upon request to any unit owner or person who has executed a contract for the purchase of a condominium unit a recordable statement certifying to any waiver of or failure or refusal to exercise such rights and restraints whenever such waiver, failure, or refusal has occurred. Failure or refusal to furnish that statement within 30 days or such lesser period as the condominium instruments may specify shall cause all such rights and restraints to be inapplicable to the disposition of the condominium unit in contemplation of which such statement was requested. Any such statement shall be binding on the association and on every unit owner. Payment of a fee not exceeding $25.00 may be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of such a statement if the condominium instruments so provide.

Every lot owner and all those entitled to occupy a lot shall comply with all lawful provisions of the property owners' association instrument.  In addition, any lot owner and all those entitled to occupy a lot shall comply with any reasonable rules or regulations adopted by the association pursuant to the instrument which have been provided to the lot owners and with the lawful provisions of the bylaws of the association.  Any lack of such compliance shall be grounds for an action to recover sums due, for damages or injunctive relief, or for any other remedy available at law or in equity, maintainable by the association or, in any proper case, by one or more aggrieved lot owners on their own behalf or as a class action.  If and to the extent provided in the instrument, the association shall be empowered to impose and assess fines and suspend temporarily voting rights and the right of use of certain of the common areas and services paid for as a common expense in order to enforce such compliance; provided, however, that no such suspension shall deny any lot owner or occupants access to the lot owned or occupied.

No such proxy shall be revocable except as provided in Code Section 14-2-722 or Code Section 14-3-724 or by written notice delivered to the association by the lot owner or by any joint owners of a lot. Any proxy shall be void if it is not dated or if it purports to be revocable without such notice.

If the instrument provides that any member of the board of directors or any officer of the association must be a lot owner, then, notwithstanding Code Section 44-3-221, the term "lot owner" in such context shall, unless the instrument otherwise provides, be deemed to include, without limitation, any shareholder, director, officer, partner in, or trustee of any person who is, either alone or in conjunction with any other person or persons, a lot owner. Any individual who would not be eligible to serve as a member of the board of directors or officer were he or she not a shareholder, director, officer, partner in, or trustee of such a person shall be deemed to have disqualified himself or herself from continuing in office if he or she ceases to have any such affiliation with that person.

If the declarant fails to cure any or all deficiencies identified in the notice within 30 days of such notice, then any owner, acting individually or jointly with other owners, shall have standing individually, and not solely through a derivative action, to institute an action in the superior court of the county in which any portion of the property owner's association is located in order to obtain a declaratory judgment to grant the owner or owners control of the association by ordering an election and setting the terms thereof, or issuing any other orders appropriate to transfer control of the association. The superior court shall have authority to hold a hearing and issue a summary ruling on said action at any time designated by the court not earlier than 20 days after the service thereof, unless the parties consent in writing to an earlier trial. No discovery shall be had unless ordered by the court for good cause. In addition, the superior court shall be authorized to issue a summary ruling on the conveyance of any intended common areas or other property in the common interest community to the association or other appropriate entity. If the owner or owners prevail in such action, then the superior court shall award to the owner or owners all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred for the prosecution of such action. This Code section shall not be the basis for any liability against any party or agent of any party outside of the exclusive remedies provided herein.

          <content>
            <p>§ 44-4-22. Alternative plane coordinates for expressing location of a point for Georgia Coordinate System and Georgia Coordinate System of 1985
The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, used to express the geographic position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of this system, shall consist of two distances expressed in U.S. Survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the Georgia Coordinate System and expressed in either meters and decimals of a meter or, following conversion as provided in Code Section 44-4-28, in American Survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the Georgia Coordinate System of 1985.  One of these distances, to be known as the "x-coordinate," shall give the position in an east-and-west direction; the other, to be known as the "y-coordinate," shall give the position in a north-and-south direction.  These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as published by the National Ocean Survey/National Geodetic Survey, formerly the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this article.  Any such control monument may be used for establishing a survey connection to either Georgia Coordinate System.

No coordinates based on either Georgia Coordinate System purporting to define the position of a point on a land boundary shall be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless such point has been connected by survey to a monumented horizontal control station that is identified and has been established in conformity with the standards of accuracy and specifications as prepared and published by the Federal Geodetic Control Committee of the United States Department of Commerce. Standards and specifications of the Federal Geodetic Control Committee or its successors in force on the date of said survey shall apply. The publishing of the existing control stations, or the acceptance with intent to publish the newly established control stations, by the National Ocean Survey/National Geodetic Survey will constitute evidence of adherence to the Federal Geodetic Control Committee specifications.

A deed to personalty needs no attesting witness to make it valid; in other respects, the principles applicable to deeds to lands are applicable to deeds to personalty. However, generally a deed is not necessary to convey title to personalty.

            <p>§ 44-5-35. Apportionment of price for deficiency in number of acres; rescission
In a sale of lands, if the purchase is per acre, a deficiency in the number of acres may be apportioned in the price. If the sale is by the tract or the entire body, a deficiency in the quantity sold cannot be apportioned. If the sale is by a quantity of acres with the qualification "more or less" added, any deficiency is not apportionable unless the deficiency is so great as to constitute a willful deception or mistake amounting to fraud. In this event, the purchaser may demand a rescission of the sale or an apportionment of the purchase price.

A deed, security deed, bill of sale to secure debt, or any other conveyance of property or interest in property to or by a minor is voidable unless such minor has become emancipated by operation of law or pursuant to Article 10 of Chapter 11 of Title 15. If a minor has conveyed property or an interest in property, the minor may void the conveyance upon arrival at the age of 18; and, if the minor makes another conveyance at that time, it will void the first conveyance without reentry or repossession. If property or an interest in property has been conveyed to a minor and, after arrival at the age of 18, the minor retains the possession or benefit of the property or interest in property, the minor shall have thereby ratified or affirmed the conveyance.

            <p>§ 44-5-65. Action for breach of warranty -- Necessity for offer to rescind; mitigation of damages
To recover upon a breach of a covenant of warranty of title, the warrantee need not offer to rescind the deed. However, an offer by the warrantor to rescind the deed and a refusal by the warrantee should be considered in estimating damages.

            <p>§ 44-5-66. Action for breach of warranty -- Measure of damages
Upon a breach of a covenant of warranty of title to land, the damages awarded should be the purchase money with interest thereon from the time of sale unless the jury determines, under the circumstances of the case, that the use of the premises was equal to the interest on the money and determines that an equitable setoff should be allowed. However, if valuable improvements have been made on the premises, the interest should be allowed.

Upon the breach of a bond for title to land, the value of the premises at the time of the breach with interest thereon should be the measure of damages. However, if the vendee has bought up the outstanding title, only the actual damage sustained by him may be recovered.

However, a custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor's estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor without reference to the laws relating to permissible investments by fiduciaries.</p>

          <content>
            <p>§ 44-5-165. How actual possession of lands evidenced
Actual possession of lands may be evidenced by enclosure, cultivation, or any use and occupation of the lands which is so notorious as to attract the attention of every adverse claimant and so exclusive as to prevent actual occupation by another. As to any claim which is not vested under this chapter prior to July 1, 2008, no party shall attempt to establish possession of lands for purposes of this article for any lands depicted within the applicable tract identified on the official map of any railroad filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to the Railroad Valuation Act of March 1, 1913, Stat. 701, as amended, unless such party establishes that such occupancy interferes with the operations of such railroad corporation or railroad company; provided, however, that each railroad corporation and railroad company shall file and record such official map of the railroad with the superior court for the county in which such land depicted on such official railroad map is situated. Any court of this state shall take judicial notice of the information set forth in any such official map properly filed and recorded by such railroad corporation or railroad company. This Code section shall not be applied to adverse claims of aboveground utilities which have been initiated but which have not vested prior to July 1, 2008; provided, however, that a railroad corporation or railroad company shall not be precluded from enforcing rights of ownership against any adverse claims which have not vested.

Possession under a duly recorded deed shall be construed to extend to all the contiguous property embraced in such deed. To the extent that any such property is bounded on one or more sides by a railroad, and the description of the property contained in such deed makes reference to the railroad or the railroad right of way as a boundary for such property, such reference shall be construed to mean that the boundary line is located at the edge of the tract depicted on the official map of the railroad filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to the Railroad Valuation Act of March 1, 1913, Stat. 701, as amended, and such depictions contained on such official railroad map shall be conclusive as to the location of the boundary line between the property of the railroad and any adjoining property owner as of the date of such railroad map; provided, however, that each railroad corporation and railroad company shall file and record such official map of the railroad with the superior court for the county in which such land depicted on such official railroad map is situated. Any court of this state shall take judicial notice of the information set forth in any such official map properly filed and recorded by such railroad corporation or railroad company.

            <p>§ 44-6-21. Words necessary to create absolute estate; preference for construing as conveyance; maker's intention controls; parol evidence
The word "heirs" or its equivalent is not necessary to create an absolute estate. Every properly executed conveyance shall be construed to convey the fee unless a lesser estate is mentioned and limited in that conveyance. If a lesser estate is expressly limited, the courts shall not, by construction, increase such estate into a fee but, disregarding all technical rules, shall give effect to the intention of the maker of the instrument, as far as the same is lawful, if the intention can be gathered from the contents of the instrument. If the court cannot gather the intention of the maker from the contents of the instrument, it may hear parol evidence to prove the maker's intention.

            <p>§ 44-6-22. Creation of estate to commence in future; fee in abeyance; fee limited upon fee
An absolute estate may be created to commence in the future, and the fee may be in abeyance without detriment to the rights of subsequent remainders. A fee may be limited upon a fee, either by deed or will, where the plain intention of the grantor or testator requires it and no other rule of law is violated thereby.

            <p>§ 44-6-41. Conditions precedent and subsequent distinguished; preferred construction and remedy
Conditions may be either precedent or subsequent; conditions precedent require performance before the estate shall vest, and conditions subsequent may cause a forfeiture of a vested estate. The law favors conditions to be subsequent rather than precedent and to be remediable by damages rather than by forfeiture.

Remainders are either vested or contingent. A vested remainder is a remainder which is limited to a certain person at a certain time or which is dependent upon the happening of a necessary event. A contingent remainder is a remainder which is limited to an uncertain person or which is dependent upon an event which may or may not happen.

Upon the demand of anyone interested in the remainder or his agent or attorney, which demand shall be accompanied by a statement under oath of his interest, it shall be the duty of the officer making the sale of a life estate in personalty under process of law to require the purchaser to give bond in double the value of the property, with good security, for the delivery of the property to the remainderman. The bond shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the sale is made and shall be subject to an action on the bond by any person who is interested in the remainder. On the failure of the purchaser to give such bond, the property shall be resold at his risk, provided that notice of the demand for such bond was given before he made the purchase.

            <p>§ 44-6-101. Estate for years distinguished from contract of hiring and from landlord and tenant relationship
As applied to personalty, an estate for years differs from a contract of hiring, which is a bailment conveying no interest in the property to the bailee but merely the right of use. As applied to realty, an estate for years does not involve the relationship of landlord and tenant, in which relationship the tenant has no estate but merely has a right of use which is very similar to the right of a hirer of personalty.

            <p>§ 44-6-102. "Lease" defined; extent of interest; when mining interest passes
The grant by one person to another of an estate for years out of his own estate, with reversion to himself, is usually termed a lease. Such a lease may be confined to a particular interest in lands, such as the right to mine or farm the same, in which case no other interest shall pass. If no subject of the lease is stated, the right to mine the land in question shall not pass unless the circumstances justify the implication that the parties intended the mining interest to pass.

          <content>
            <p>§ 44-6-103. Tenant's rights and duties; grounds of forfeiture
An estate for years carries with it the right to use the property in as absolute a manner as may be done with a greater estate, provided that the property or the person who is entitled to the remainder or reversion interest is not injured by such use. The acts of omission and commission prescribed as grounds of forfeiture of an estate for life shall operate to the same effect as against a tenant for years.

            <p>§ 44-6-106. Dependent and independent covenants or conditions
In light of the entire instrument, the dependence or independence of covenants or conditions must be determined from the intention of the parties. If the conditions are dependent, the failure of the person first required to act shall be an excuse to the other party for failing to comply; if the conditions are independent, no such excuse shall avail. The law favors conditions to be independent.

In such a case, no estate passes out of the landlord and the tenant has only a usufruct which may not be conveyed except by the landlord's consent and which is not subject to levy and sale.</p>

No county or municipal corporation may enact, maintain, or enforce any ordinance or resolution which would regulate in any way the amount of rent to be charged for privately owned, single-family or multiple-unit residential rental property. This Code section shall not be construed as prohibiting any county or municipal corporation, or any authority created by a county or municipal corporation for that purpose, from regulating in any way property belonging to such county, such municipal corporation, or such authority from entering into any agreements with private persons, which agreements regulate the amount of rent to be charged for such rental properties.

          <content>
            <p>§ 44-7-20. Notification to prospective tenant of property's propensity toward flooding
When the owner of real property, either directly or through an agent, seeks to lease or rent that property for residential occupancy, prior to entering a written agreement for the leasehold of that property, the owner shall, either directly or through an agent, notify the prospective tenant in writing of the property's propensity of flooding if flooding has damaged any portion of the living space covered by the lease or attachments thereto to which the tenant or the tenant's resident relative has sole and exclusive use under the written agreement at least three times during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the lease. An owner failing to give such notice shall be liable in tort to the tenant and the tenant's family residing on the leased premises for damages to the personal property of the lessee or a resident relative of the lessee which is proximately caused by flooding which occurs during the term of the lease. For purposes of this Code section, flooding is defined as the inundation of a portion of the living space covered by the lease which was caused by an increased water level in an established water source such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch or as a ponding of water at or near the point where heavy or excessive rain fell. This Code section shall apply only to leaseholds entered into on or after July 1, 1995.

Upon any sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition, including, without limitation, by reason of the enforcement of any mortgage, lien, deed to secure debt, or other security instrument, of a landlord's interest in real property or upon any sale, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of a tenant's leasehold interest, the succeeding party shall be bound for all obligations occurring after the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition with the same effect as if such succeeding party had expressly assumed the landlord's or tenant's obligations relating to the written brokerage commission agreement if:</p>

              <p>of Code Section 44-7-33, a landlord shall return to the tenant the full security deposit which was deposited with the landlord by the tenant. No security deposit shall be retained to cover ordinary wear and tear which occurred as a result of the use of the premises for the purposes for which the premises were intended, provided that there was no negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse of the premises by the tenant or members of his or her household or their invitees or guests. In the event that actual cause exists for retaining any portion of the security deposit, the landlord shall provide the tenant with a written statement identifying the exact reasons for the retention thereof, which shall include the comprehensive list of damages prepared as required by Code Section 44-7-33, if the reason for retention is based on damages to the premises. When such statement is delivered, it shall be accompanied by a payment of the difference between any sum deposited and the amount retained. The landlord shall be deemed to have complied with this Code section by mailing such statement and any payment required to the last known address of the tenant via first-class mail. If the letter containing the payment is returned to the landlord undelivered and if the landlord is unable to locate the tenant after reasonable effort, the payment shall become the property of the landlord 90 days after the date the payment was mailed. Nothing in this Code section shall preclude the landlord from retaining the security deposit for nonpayment of rent or of fees for late payment, for abandonment of the premises, for nonpayment of utility charges, for repair work or cleaning contracted for by the tenant with third parties, for unpaid pet fees, or for actual damages caused by the tenant's breach, provided that the landlord attempts to mitigate the actual damages.</p>

If the tenant refuses or fails to deliver possession when so demanded, the owner or the agent, attorney at law, or attorney in fact of such owner may immediately go before the judge of the superior court, the judge of the state court, or the clerk or deputy clerk of either court, or the judge or the clerk or deputy clerk of any other court with jurisdiction over the subject matter, or a magistrate in the district where the land lies and make an affidavit under oath to the facts.

          <content>
            <p>§ 44-7-115. (Effective May 1, 2019) Foreclosure of liens on abandoned or intact mobile homesNotwithstanding any conflicting provisions in Code Section 44-14-349, all liens acquired upon an abandoned mobile home or intact mobile home under Code Section 44-7-113 shall be foreclosed as follows:
(1)  Any proceeding to foreclose a lien on an abandoned mobile home determined to be intact by a local government agent shall be instituted in the magistrate court of the county where such mobile home is located within one year from the time the lien is recorded;

(2)  The person desiring to foreclose a lien on an abandoned mobile home determined to be intact by a local government agent shall, by certified or registered mail or statutory overnight delivery, make a demand upon the responsible party in the amount of the lien and for the payment of rent and fees accrued after the filing of the lien; provided that the amount of such rent shall not exceed $3.00 per day. If the responsible party cannot be located, notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation for two consecutive weeks;(3)  (A) If, within 30 days of delivery to the appropriate address of the written demand required by paragraph (2) of this Code section or within 30 days after the last publication in a newspaper, the responsible party fails to respond to such demand or refuses to pay, or if the responsible party cannot be ascertained, the landowner may move to foreclose such lien. The person asserting such lien may move to foreclose by making an affidavit to a magistrate court showing all facts necessary to constitute such lien and the amount claimed to be due. Such affidavit shall aver that the notice requirements of Code Section 44-7-113 have been complied with, and such affidavit shall also aver that a demand for payment has been made and refused or that the identity of the responsible party cannot be ascertained. The landowner shall verify the statement by oath or affirmation with a signature affixed thereto.
(B)  In addition to the filing fees required by Code Section 15-10-80, the fee for filing such affidavit shall be $5.00 per abandoned mobile home upon which a lien is asserted;(4)  (A) Upon the filing of such affidavit, the person asserting such lien shall give the clerk or judge of the court the address, if known, of all responsible parties and the clerk or judge of the court shall serve notice informing such responsible parties of a right to a hearing to determine if reasonable cause exists to believe that a valid debt exists; that such hearing shall be petitioned for within 30 days of receipt of such notice; and that, if no petition for such hearing is filed within the time allowed, the lien shall conclusively be deemed a valid one, foreclosure thereof allowed, and a public sale pursuant to Code Section 44-7-116 shall be authorized.
(B)  Any notice required by this paragraph shall be by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery or, if the responsible party is unknown, by posting such notice at the county courthouse in such place where other public notices are posted;

(5)  If a petition for a hearing is filed within the time allowed pursuant to paragraph (4) of this Code section, the magistrate court shall set such a hearing within ten days of filing of the petition. Upon the filing of such petition by a party defendant, neither the prosecuting lienholder nor the court may sell the mobile home. If, at the hearing, the magistrate court determines there is reasonable cause to believe that a valid debt exists, then the person asserting the lien shall retain possession of the mobile home or the court shall obtain possession of the mobile home, as ordered by the court;

(6)  If no petition for a hearing is filed, or if, after a full hearing, the magistrate court determines that a valid debt exists, the court shall authorize foreclosure upon and sale of the mobile home subject to the lien to satisfy the debt if such debt is not otherwise immediately paid. The holder of a security interest in or a lien on the mobile home, other than the holder of a lien created by Code Section 44-7-113, shall have the right, in the order of priority of such security interest or lien, to pay the debt and court costs no later than 15 days after a magistrate court's order to authorize the foreclosure. If the holder of a security interest or lien does so pay the debt and court costs, such person shall have the right to possession of the mobile home, and that person's security interest in or lien on such mobile home shall be increased by the amount so paid. A magistrate court order shall be issued to this effect, and in this instance there shall not be a sale of the mobile home. If the debt owed is not timely paid by the holder of a security interest or an appeal of the magistrate court decision has not been timely filed pursuant to paragraph (8) of this Code section, the court shall issue an order authorizing the sale of such mobile home;

Running water belongs to the owner of the land on which it runs; but the landowner has no right to divert the water from its usual channel nor may he so use or adulterate it as to interfere with the enjoyment of it by the next owner.

            <p>§ 44-8-2. Nonnavigable streams -- Rights of adjoining owners; principles when stream is boundary; accretions
The beds of nonnavigable streams belong to the owner of the adjacent land. If the stream is a dividing line between two parcels of land, each owner's boundary shall extend to the thread or the center of the main current of the water. If the current changes gradually, the boundary line follows the current. If from any cause the stream takes a new channel, the original line, if identifiable, remains the boundary. Gradual accretions of land on either side accrue to the owner of that side.

            <p>§ 44-8-6. Nonnavigable tidewaters; title; rights of adjoining landowners; principles when tidewaters are boundaries; accretions
The title to the beds of all nonnavigable tidewaters where the tide regularly ebbs and flows shall vest in the owner of the adjacent land for all purposes, including, among others, the exclusive right to the oysters, clams, and other shellfish therein or thereon. If the water is the dividing line between two parcels of land, each owner's boundary shall extend to the main thread or channel of the water. If the main thread or channel of the water changes gradually, the boundary line shall follow the same according to the change. If for any cause the water takes a new channel, the original line, if identifiable, remains the boundary. Gradual accretions of land on either side accrue to the owner of that side.

              <p>A navigable tidewater is any tidewater, the sea or any inlet thereof, or any other bed of water where the tide regularly ebbs and flows which is in fact used for the purposes of navigation or is capable of transporting at mean low tide boats loaded with freight in the regular course of trade. The mere rafting of timber thereon or the passage of small boats thereover, whether for the transportation of persons or freight, shall not be deemed navigation within the meaning of this Code section and shall not make tidewaters navigable.</p>

            <p>§ 44-8-10. Construction or establishment of private bridge or ferry; grant of franchise to construct or operate public bridge or ferry; compensation to landowner for interference with possession; when franchise exclusive generally; exclusive franchises pertaining to streets or sidewalks
The right to construct a bridge or to establish a ferry for private use across a watercourse within or adjoining one's lands is appurtenant to the ownership of the land; but the right to establish and operate a public bridge or ferry is a franchise to be granted by the state. Where the grant of such a franchise interferes with an owner's right of exclusive possession, just compensation must first be paid to the landowner. No such franchise granted by this state shall be held to be exclusive unless it is plainly and expressly declared to be exclusive in the grant; except, however, that any municipality of this state having a population of more than 200,000 according to the United States decennial census of 1930 or any future such census is authorized to grant an exclusive franchise pertaining to streets or sidewalks for a period of three years, but not subject to renewal, to any person, firm, or corporation under this authority to grant such a franchise whether or not it is plainly or expressly stated in the charter of the municipality.

            <p>§ 44-9-1. Methods of acquiring private ways
The right of private way over another's land may arise from an express grant, from prescription by seven years' uninterrupted use through improved lands or by 20 years' use through wild lands, by implication of law when the right is necessary to the enjoyment of lands granted by the same owner, or by compulsory purchase and sale through the superior court in the manner prescribed by Article 3 of this chapter.

A parol license to use another's land is revocable at any time if its revocation does no harm to the person to whom it has been granted. A parol license is not revocable when the licensee has acted pursuant thereto and in so doing has incurred expense; in such case, it becomes an easement running with the land.

            <p>§ 44-9-21. Legislative findings and declaration of policy
The General Assembly finds that the use of solar energy in this state can help reduce the nation's reliance upon imported fuels and that solar energy development should, therefore, be encouraged. The General Assembly further finds that, as the use of solar energy devices increases, the possibility of future shading of such devices by buildings or vegetation will also increase. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that solar easements may be established to allow the owner of a solar energy device to negotiate for assurance of continued access to sunlight.

              <p>When any person or corporation of this state owns real estate or any interest therein to which the person or corporation has no means of access, ingress, and egress and when a means of ingress, egress, and access may be had over and across the lands of any private person or corporation, such person or corporation may file his or its petition in the superior court of the county having jurisdiction; said petition shall allege such facts and shall pray for a judgment condemning an easement of access, ingress, and egress not to exceed 20 feet in width over and across the property of the private person or corporation. The filing of the petition shall be deemed to be the declaration of necessity; however, where it appears that the condemnor owns a right of access, ingress, and egress to his property over another route or owns an easement to a right of private way over another route, which right or easement is not less than 20 feet in width and which alternate route affords such person or corporation a reasonable means of access, ingress, and egress, or where the judge shall find that the exercise of such right of condemnation by the condemnor is otherwise unreasonable, the judge of the superior court is authorized under such circumstances to find that the condemnation and the declaration of necessity constitute an abuse of discretion and to enjoin the proceeding.

            <p>§ 44-9-47. Motions and proceedings subsequent to judgment; payment of compensation; nonpayment as abandonment; effect of abandonment on subsequent application
With respect to the judgment of the court in such case, any party may have all remedies provided by law, including a motion for a new trial, a motion for an appeal, a motion for judgment on the pleadings, or a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Before the judgment becomes final and after the determination of any motions or appeals, the compensation fixed by the jury shall be paid in cash into the registry of the court by the applicant; and, upon the failure to pay the compensation, the private way applied for shall be considered abandoned. Upon a motion made by any interested party and a notice of not less than ten days to the applicant for the private way, the court shall enter a judgment of abandonment accordingly. If the right to the private way is abandoned in this manner and, after notice to the applicant, the court so finds, no application for a private way over the same land shall thereafter be filed by the same applicant or his successor in title.

The rule shall be served by the sheriff or his deputy at least three days before the day set for the hearing; and when the day arrives the judge shall proceed to hear evidence as to the obstructions or other interference. If it appears that the private way has been in continuous, uninterrupted use for seven years or more and no steps were taken to prevent the enjoyment of the same, the judge shall grant an order directing the party or parties so obstructing or otherwise interfering with the right of way to remove the obstructions or other interference within 48 hours; and, if the party or parties fail to remove the obstructions, the judge shall issue a warrant commanding the sheriff to remove the obstructions immediately.</p>
