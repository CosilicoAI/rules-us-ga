All conviction data received by the department or by the applicant or licensee shall be used by the party requesting such data for the exclusive purpose of carrying out the responsibilities of this article, shall not be a public record, shall be confidential, and shall not be disclosed to any other person or agency except to any person or agency which otherwise has a legal right to inspect such data.

              <p>of this Code section, checks may be accepted for collection with payment deferred where the licensee has posted a surety bond in the same manner as prescribed for licensed money transmitters or licensed payment instrument sellers under Code Section 7-1-683.2 and under the same conditions as set forth under Code Section 7-1-687. The surety bond shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000.00 for each location operated by the licensee, if the licensee operates three or fewer locations, plus $5,000.00 per location for the fourth and fifth locations operated by the licensee, plus $1,000.00 for each location operated by the licensee in excess of the fifth location. The bond shall be in a form satisfactory to the department and shall run to the State of Georgia for the benefit of any claimant against the licensee arising out of the licensee's business of cashing payment instruments with payment deferred in this state. The bond shall not be canceled by either the licensee or the corporate surety except upon notice to the department by registered or certified mail, statutory overnight delivery with return receipt requested, or electronically through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry, and such cancellation shall be effective no sooner than 30 days after receipt by the department of such notice. In no event shall payment of a check be deferred past the time the licensee has collected on the check. Upon collection, payment shall be made immediately to the party from whom the licensee accepted the check.</p>

            <p>§ 7-1-731. "Domestic international banking facility" defined
As used in this article, the term "domestic international banking facility" means the location within this state of any banking office, other than an "international bank agency," as defined in Code Section 7-1-710, which derives its funds (1) from sources outside of the United States, (2) from another domestic international banking facility, or (3) from temporary advances from its parent organization and employs those funds for banking purposes outside of the United States or through its parent organization, but does not accept deposits subject to check or draft. A domestic international banking facility, when properly established pursuant to this article, shall not be considered to be a "branch office" or "main office" as defined in Code Section 7-1-600.

The board of directors shall consist of such number, not less than 15 nor more than 21, as shall be determined in the first instance by the incorporators and thereafter annually by the members and the shareholders of the corporation. The board of directors may exercise all the powers of the corporation except such as are conferred by law or by the bylaws of the corporation upon the shareholders or members and shall choose and appoint all the agents and officers of the corporation and fill all vacancies except vacancies in the office of director, which shall be filled as provided in this Code section.

At such annual meeting or at each special meeting held as provided in this Code section, the members of the corporation shall elect two-thirds of the board of directors and the shareholders shall elect the remaining directors. The directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the corporation or special meeting held in lieu of the annual meeting after the election and until their successors are elected and qualified, unless sooner removed in accordance with provisions of the bylaws. Any vacancy in the office of a director elected by the members shall be filled by the directors elected by the members, and any vacancy in the office of a director elected by the shareholders shall be filled by the directors elected by the shareholders. Directors and officers shall not be responsible for losses unless the same shall have been occasioned by the willful misconduct of such directors and officers.

(1)  An association is "local" if the greater portion of its investment in real estate loans is limited to loans on the security of a first lien or security title on real estate. Any such association may purchase real estate loans or interests in real estate loans which are made and owned by any savings and loan association to the extent authorized by the regulations of the department, provided that such regulations shall not permit the purchase of loans or interests in loans of any type or in any amounts (per individual loan or in the aggregate) which are not permitted by law to be purchased by savings and loan associations with principal offices in this state.

(2)  An association is "mutual" if all depositors in such association participate in the income of such association and if all borrowers are privileged to vote at least one vote at any meeting of members, it being unnecessary that any borrower should subscribe to or purchase any shares or be entitled to participate in any way in the income of such association.

            <p>§ 7-1-795. Savings account books and certificates
The original record of deposits in savings and loan associations is the record on the books of the association, and the depositor shall be entitled to a savings account book or certificate which is a duplicate of such record. Those dealing with such savings account books and certificates shall be bound by the record on the books of the association. In the event of the loss or destruction of any such savings account book or certificate, any association may, upon receipt of an affidavit of such loss or destruction, issue a duplicate thereof and remain liable only to the holder or holders as shown on the records of the association. The only way an effective transfer or pledge may be accomplished so as to affect the rights of the association is by transfer on the books of the association in the case of transfer or written notice of a pledge entered on the books of the association and acknowledged in writing in the case of a pledge; and the association shall be protected in paying any part of a deposit to the holder thereof as shown on the books of the association unless it has received written notice of a pledge or transfer thereof.

          <content>
            <p>§ 7-1-810. DefinitionsAs used in this article, the term:
(1)  "Account" means a contract of deposit of funds between a depositor and a financial institution and includes a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit, share account, and other like arrangements.

(2)  "Beneficiary" means a person named in a trust account as one for whom a party to the account is named as trustee.

(3)  "Financial institution" means a savings and loan association as defined in paragraph (31) of Code Section 7-1-4 or any financial institution as defined in paragraph (21) of Code Section 7-1-4.

(4)  "Joint account" means an account payable on request to one or more of two or more parties, whether or not mention is made of any right of survivorship.(5)  "Multiple-party account" means any of the following types of account:
(A)  A joint account;

(B)  A P.O.D. account; or

(C)  A trust account.
   It does not include accounts established for deposit of funds of a partnership, joint venture, or other association for business purposes; accounts controlled by one or more persons as the duly authorized agent or trustee for a corporation, unincorporated association, or charitable or civic organization; or a regular fiduciary or trust account where the relationship is established other than by deposit agreement.

(6)  "Net contribution" of a party to a multiple-party account as of any given time means the sum of all deposits thereto made by or for him, less all withdrawals made by or for him which have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance. The term includes, in addition, any proceeds of deposit life insurance added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question.

(7)  "Party" means a person who, by the terms of the account, has a present right, subject to request, to payment from a multiple-party account. A P.O.D. payee or beneficiary of a trust account is a party only after the account becomes payable to him by reason of his surviving the original payee or trustee. Unless the context otherwise requires, it includes a guardian, conservator, personal representative, or assignee, including an attaching creditor, of a party. It also includes a person identified as a trustee of an account for another, whether or not a beneficiary is named; but it does not include any named beneficiary unless he has a present right of withdrawal.

(8)  "Payment" of sums on deposit includes withdrawal, payment on check or other directive of a party, and any pledge of sums on deposit by a party and any setoff or reduction or other disposition of all or part of an account pursuant to a pledge.

(9)  "Proof of death" includes a death certificate or official record which is prima-facie proof of death.

(10)  "P.O.D. account" means an account payable on request to one person during his or her lifetime or to an incorporated entity and on such person's death to one or more P.O.D. payees or to one or more persons during their lifetimes or to an incorporated entity and on the death of all of them or the dissolution of the incorporated entity to one or more P.O.D. payees.

(11)  "P.O.D. payee" means a person or an incorporated entity designated on a P.O.D. account as one to whom the account is payable on request after the death of one or more persons.

(12)  "Request" means a proper request for withdrawal or a check or order for payment which complies with all conditions of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the financial institution; but, if the financial institution conditions withdrawal or payment on advance notice, for purposes of this article the request for withdrawal or payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for withdrawal.

(13)  "Sums on deposit" means the balance payable on a multiple-party account, including interest, dividends, and, in addition, any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of a party.

(14)  "Trust account" means an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries where the relationship is established by the form of the account and the deposit agreement with the financial institution and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account; it is not essential that payment to the beneficiary be mentioned in the deposit agreement. A trust account does not include a regular trust account under a testamentary trust or a trust agreement which has significance apart from the account or a fiduciary account arising from a fiduciary relation such as attorney-client.

(15)  "Withdrawal" includes payment to a third person pursuant to check or other directive of a party.

Code Sections 7-1-812 through 7-1-814, concerning beneficial ownership as between parties or as between parties and P.O.D. payees or beneficiaries of multiple-party accounts, are relevant only to controversies between those persons and their creditors and other successors and have no bearing on the power of withdrawal of these persons as determined by the terms of account contracts. Code Sections 7-1-816 through 7-1-821 govern the liability of financial institutions which make payments pursuant thereto and their setoff rights.

Without qualifying any other statutory right to setoff or lien and subject to any contractual provision, if a party to a multiple-party account is indebted to a financial institution, the financial institution has a right to setoff against the account in which the party has or had immediately before his death a present right of withdrawal. The amount of the account subject to setoff is that proportion to which the debtor is or was immediately before his death beneficially entitled and, in the absence of proof of net contributions, an equal share with all parties having present rights of withdrawal.

The business affairs of the corporation shall be managed and controlled by a board of directors, a president, a vice-president, a secretary, a treasurer, and such other officers and such agents as the corporation shall authorize by its bylaws.  The board of directors shall consist of such number, not less than nine nor more than 15, as shall be determined in the first instance by the incorporators and thereafter annually by the members and the shareholders of the corporation.  The board of directors may exercise all the powers of the corporation except such as are conferred by law or by the bylaws of the corporation upon the shareholders or members and shall choose and appoint all the agents and officers of the corporation and fill all vacancies except vacancies in the office of director, which shall be filled as provided in this Code section. The annual meeting shall be held prior to May 1 or, if no annual meeting shall be held in the year of incorporation, then within 90 days after the approval of the articles at a special meeting as provided in this Code section.  At such annual meeting or at each special meeting held as provided in this Code section, the members of the corporation shall elect one-fifth of the board of directors and the shareholders shall elect the remaining directors.  The directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the corporation or special meeting held in lieu of the annual meeting after the election and until their successors are elected and qualified, unless sooner removed in accordance with provisions of the bylaws. Any vacancy in the office of a director elected by the members shall be filled by the directors elected by the members, and any vacancy in the office of a director elected by the shareholders shall be filled by the directors elected by the shareholders. Directors and officers shall not be responsible for losses unless the same shall have been occasioned by the willful misconduct of such directors and officers.  Directors shall serve without compensation.

              <p>Every mortgage broker and mortgage lender licensee, registrant, and applicant shall be authorized and required to obtain background checks on covered employees. Such background checks shall be handled by the Georgia Crime Information Center pursuant to Code Section 35-3-34 and the rules and regulations of the Georgia Crime Information Center. Licensees, registrants, and applicants shall be responsible for any applicable fees charged by the center. A background check shall be initiated for a person in the employ of a licensee, registrant, or applicant within ten days of the date of initial hire and be completed with satisfactory results within the first 90 days of employment. This provision shall not apply to directors, officers, partners, agents, or ultimate equitable owners of 10 percent or more or to persons who direct the company's affairs or establish policy, whose background shall have been investigated through the department before taking office, beginning employment, or securing ownership. Upon receipt of information from the Georgia Crime Information Center that is incomplete or that indicates an employee has a criminal record in any state other than Georgia, the employer shall submit to the department two complete sets of fingerprints of such person, together with the applicable fees and any other required information. The department shall submit such fingerprints as provided in subsection</p>

              <p>Upon receipt of fingerprints, fees, and other required information, the Georgia Crime Information Center shall promptly transmit one set of fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a search of bureau records and an appropriate report and shall retain the other set and promptly conduct a search of its own records and records to which it has access. The Georgia Crime Information Center shall notify the department in writing of any derogatory finding, including, but not limited to, any conviction data regarding the fingerprint records check, or if there is no such finding. All conviction data received by the department or by the applicant, registrant, or licensee shall be used by the party requesting such data for the exclusive purpose of carrying out the responsibilities of this article, shall not be a public record, shall be privileged, and shall not be disclosed to any other person or agency except to any person or agency which otherwise has a legal right to inspect the file. The department shall be entitled to review any applicant's, registrant's, or licensee's files to determine whether the required background checks have been run and whether all covered employees are qualified. The department shall be authorized to discuss the status of employee background checks with licensees. All such records shall be maintained by the department and the applicant or licensee or registrant pursuant to laws regarding such records and the rules and regulations of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Georgia Crime Information Center, as applicable. As used in this subsection, "conviction data" means a record of a finding, verdict, or plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendere with regard to any crime, regardless of whether an appeal of the conviction has been sought, subject to the conditions set forth in subsection</p>

In order to avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the department may accept examination reports performed and produced by other state or federal agencies, unless the department determines that the examinations are not available or do not provide information necessary to fulfill the responsibilities of the department under this article.</p>

              <p>Whenever it shall appear to the department that any person required to be licensed or registered under this article or employed by a licensee or who would be covered by the prohibitions in Code Section 7-1-1013 has violated any law of this state or any order or regulation of the department, the department may issue an initial written order requiring such person to cease and desist immediately from such unauthorized practices. Such cease and desist order shall be final 20 days after it is issued unless the person to whom it is issued makes a written request within such 20 day period for a hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." A cease and desist order to an unlicensed person that orders such person to cease doing a mortgage business without the appropriate license shall be final 30 days from the date of issuance, and there shall be no opportunity for an administrative hearing. If the proper license or evidence of exemption or valid employment status during the time of the alleged offense is delivered to the department within the 30 day period, the order shall be rescinded by the department. If a cease and desist order is issued to a person who has been sent a notice of bond cancellation and if the bond is reinstated or replaced and such documentation is delivered to the department within the 30 day period following the date of issuance of the order, the order shall be rescinded. If the notice of reinstatement of the bond is not received within the 30 days, the license shall expire at the end of the 30 day period, and the person shall be required to make a new application for license and pay the applicable fees. In the case of an unlawful purchase of mortgage loans, such initial cease and desist order to a purchaser shall constitute the knowledge required under subsection</p>

Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall allow a motion to show cause why it should not be granted. Whenever, after a hearing upon the merits or after failure of such person to appear when ordered, it shall appear that the order of the department was properly issued, the court shall grant the petition of the department.</p>

In determining the amount of penalty, the department shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty relative to the size of the financial resources of such person, the good faith efforts of such person to comply with the order, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations by such person, and such other factors or circumstances as shall have contributed to the violation. The department may at its discretion compromise, modify, or refund any penalty which is subject to imposition or has been imposed pursuant to this Code section. Any person assessed as provided in this subsection shall have the right to request a hearing into the matter within ten days after notification of the assessment has been served upon the person involved; otherwise, such penalty shall be final except as to judicial review as provided in Code Section 7-1-90.</p>

Any financial institution insured by the corporation shall have the same powers and privileges as any other state-chartered financial institution of the same class even though such other financial institution is insured under some other state or federal program. Such equality of powers shall not relieve the financial institution, whether insured under this chapter or under an alternative state or federal program, from taking appropriate action to amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws or from obtaining appropriate regulatory approvals before exercising such powers and privileges.

            <p>§ 7-3-17. Payment before maturity; refund of prepaid interest; continuing insurance
Notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary, a borrower may at any time prepay all or any part of the unpaid balance to become payable under any installment contract. If the borrower pays the time balance in full before maturity, the licensee shall refund to him a portion of the prepaid interest, calculated in complete even months (odd days omitted), as follows: The amount of the refund shall represent at least as great a proportion of the total interest as the sum of the periodical time balance after the date of prepayment bears to the sum of all periodical time balances under the schedule of payments in the original contract. Where the amount of the refund due to anticipation of payment is less than $1.00, no refund need be made. If the borrower has been required to purchase other than insurance coverage in a blanket policy when he has paid no acquisition cost, he shall have the option to continue such insurance in force for the balance of the policy period, with all rights transferred to the borrower or his assigns, in which event no refund of insurance premiums shall be made to him.

In the event the Commissioner shall find cause to believe that any person is violating this chapter or the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner pursuant to this chapter, he shall make such investigation and have such hearings, before him or such person as he designates, as will permit him to determine the facts and then may issue a cease and desist order if he so determines. If such cease and desist order is thereafter violated by the person against whom it is issued, such violation shall constitute a public nuisance; and the Commissioner is authorized to seek, and the superior courts shall grant, injunctions against such person's further violating this chapter or the lawful rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner pursuant to this chapter. Such action for injunction may be maintained notwithstanding the existence of other legal remedies or the pendency or successful completion of a criminal prosecution as for a misdemeanor.

          <content>
            <p>§ 7-4-17. Payment applied first to interest; no interest on unpaid interest; exceptionsWhen a payment is made upon any debt, it shall be applied first to the discharge of any interest due at the time, and the balance, if any, shall be applied to the reduction of the principal. If the payment does not extinguish the interest then due, no interest shall be calculated on such balance of interest and interest shall be calculated only on the principal amount up to the time of the next payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions against charging interest on unpaid interest:
(1)  On loans having first priority on real estate and on loans secured by the pledge or assignment of instruments evidencing loans having first priority on real estate, the parties by written contract may lawfully agree that unpaid interest when due shall be added to the unpaid principal balance of the indebtedness and that the increased principal balance of the indebtedness bear interest pursuant to the terms of the contract; and

(2)  On loans secured by real estate or secured by real estate and other collateral, the parties by written contract may lawfully agree that, in the event of bankruptcy, the lender or creditor may include interest on its claim pursuant to the terms of the contract.

          <content>
            <p>§ 7-8-1. DefinitionsAs used in this chapter, the term:
(1)  "Access area" means any paved walkway or sidewalk which is within 50 feet of any remote service terminal.  The term does not include any street or highway open to the use of the public or any adjacent sidewalk.

(2)  "Access device" shall have the same meaning as set forth in Federal Reserve Board Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. Part 205, promulgated pursuant to the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1601, et seq.

(3)  "Candlefoot power" means the light intensity of candles on a horizontal plane at 36 inches above ground level and five feet in front of the area to be measured.

(4)  "Control" of an access area or defined parking area means to have the present authority to determine how, when, and by whom such access area or defined parking area is to be used, maintained, lighted, and landscaped.

(5)  "Customer" means a natural person to whom an access device has been issued for personal, family, or household use.(6)  "Defined parking area" means that portion of any parking area open for customer parking which is:
(A)  Contiguous to an access area with respect to a remote service terminal;

(B)  Regularly, principally, and lawfully used for parking by users of the remote service terminal while conducting remote service terminal transactions during the hours of darkness; and(C)  Owned or leased by the operator of the remote service terminal or owned or controlled by the party leasing the remote service terminal site to the operator.
The term does not include any parking area which is not open or regularly used for parking by users of the remote service terminal who are conducting remote service terminal transactions during the hours of darkness. A parking area is not open if it is physically closed to access or if conspicuous signs indicate that it is closed. If a multiple-level parking area satisfies the conditions of this paragraph and would therefore otherwise be a defined parking area, only the single parking level deemed by the operator of the remote service terminal to be the most directly accessible to the users of the remote service terminal shall be a defined parking area.

(7)  "Financial institution" means such an institution as defined in Code Section 7-1-4.

(8)  "Hours of darkness" means the period that commences 30 minutes after sunset and ends 30 minutes before sunrise.

(9)  "Operator" means any bank, savings association, credit union, savings bank, or other business entity or any person who operates a remote service terminal, but does not include any person or entity whose primary function is to provide for the exchange, transfer, or dissemination of electronic fund transfer data.

(10)  "Owner of an automated teller machine" means the person having the right to determine the financial institutions which will be permitted to use, or participate in the usage of, the automated teller machine but does not include any person or entity whose primary function is to provide for the exchange, transfer, or dissemination of electronic fund transfer data.

(11)  "Public road" means any public right of way, including, but not limited to, structures, sidewalks, facilities, and appurtenances incidental thereto.

(12)  "Remote service terminal" means any electronic information processing device which accepts or dispenses cash in connection with a credit, deposit, or convenience account. The term does not include devices used solely to facilitate check guarantees or check authorizations or which are used in connection with the acceptance or dispensing of cash on a person-to-person basis, such as by store cashier.

              <p>It is not the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this chapter to impose a duty to relocate or modify remote service terminals upon the occurrence of any particular events or circumstances, but rather to establish a standard of good faith for the evaluation of all remote service terminals as provided in this chapter. A violation of the provisions of this chapter or any regulation made pursuant thereto will not constitute negligence per se.

              <p>All merchant funds shall be deposited immediately by the merchant acquirer limited purpose bank and shall remain in an account at a financial institution that is federally insured and authorized to do business in this state until paid over to the individual merchant; provided, however, that nothing in this Code section shall preclude a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank from making appropriate deductions for chargebacks, fees, reserves, and other costs related to providing authorized merchant acquiring services owed by the individual merchant prior to remitting the net amount to the individual merchant. At the time of deposit into the account, the funds of the individual merchant in the account shall be deemed to be the property of the individual merchant. The merchant acquirer limited purpose bank shall maintain account records that identify individual merchants and the total amount held for each individual merchant. Such records shall be maintained in good faith and in the ordinary course of business and in a manner that can be readily ascertained.
