          <p>It is declared to be contrary to the health, safety, and public welfare of the people of this state for any individual or organization to act in a manner which would mislead the public into believing that a member of the public is dealing with any municipal, county, or volunteer fire department or with a member thereof when in fact the individual or organization is not the municipal, county, or volunteer fire department or a member thereof. Furthermore, the municipal, county, or volunteer fire department, which provides quality fire protection and safety services to the citizens of this state, has established a name for excellence in its field. This name should be protected for the department, its members, and the citizens of this state. Therefore, no person or organization should be allowed to use any municipal, county, or volunteer fire department's name or any term used to identify the department or its members without the expressed permission of the local governing body. The provisions of this chapter are in furtherance of the promotion of this policy.</p>
